			The 227th meeting of the Executive Committee of IBA was held on 
			Monday, November 26, 2012 at 9:30 a.m. at Breakout Room, Aman-CED 
			Building, IBA Main Campus. The following were present:<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			1. Dr. Ishrat Husain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean &amp; Director <br>
			2. Dr. Muhammad Nishat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associate Dean, FBA <br>
			3. Dr. Sayeed Ghani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associate Dean, FCS <br>
			4. Capt. (R) Ahmed Zaheer, PN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registrar <br>
			5. Engr. Rehan-ul-Ambia Riaz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director Projects <br>
			6. Dr. Arshad Siddiqi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director ICT <br>
			7. Mr. Zafar A. Siddiqui&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director CED <br>
			8. Ms. Ayesha A. Menai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director H.R. <br>
			9. Mr. Moeid Sultan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting Director Finance <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The following items were discussed: <br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.1 To inspect and approve the seminar hall chairs for 
			Academic Block. </b> <br>
			<br>
			1.1 The Director Projects requested to see the sample of the Seminar 
			type chair selected by the Architects for two seminar halls of the 
			Academic block. Accordingly, the members inspected the model chairs. 
			The members felt that the chairs presented for inspection were not 
			suitable for a seminar room where students will need the space to 
			write and secondly they will be cramped up. The members then visited 
			the seminar room of Tabba Academic Block, Main Campus where the 
			table and chair type arrangement was put in place physically by 
			temporarily moving them from the Aman CED seminar hall. There were 
			five chairs behind the table. <br>
			<br>
			<b>DECISION</b><br>
			<br>
			1.2 The Executive Committee approved the table and chair type 
			arrangement as has been done for Aman-CED seminar hall. The 
			Executive Committee decided to add one more row on the floor so that 
			there may be twelve seminar desk with five seating capacity making 
			the total capacity of (12 x 5) = 60. <br>
			<br>
			1.3 The Executive Committee did not approve the chairs (Malaysian 
			Make) shown by the Vendor as an alternate for the computer lab, MS / 
			Ph.D office and Reception area. They emphasized that the chair 
			should exactly be the same as mentioned in the BOQ. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 2 Presentation of the up-dated case of the additional cost 
			of electrical infrastructure after the meeting with SMC, the 
			Electrical Consultant of the Buildings by Mr. Khalid Pervez. </b> <br>
			<br>
			2.1 Mr. Khalid Pervez of KP Associates informed the Committee that a 
			meeting was held with the Electrical Consultants SMC in the office 
			of Engr. Rehan-ul-Ambia wherein it was confirmed that the total 
			increase in loads was 216 kW. It was also noted that the NBCL’s 
			Consultants had used 74% Diversity Factors for Academic Block, 71% 
			for AMAN-CED, and 81% for Students Centre.<br>
			<br>
			2.2 Mr. Khalid Pervez said that the Consultants were of the opinion 
			that these factors could be reduced only if IBA guarantees that 
			there would never be full occupancy of the respective areas and 
			facilities. It thus transpired that no reduction in building loads 
			was possible. He said that he had applied 15% cushion for additional 
			future needs of the buildings. However, the same was removed in line 
			with the agreement reached in the EC meeting held on November 12, 
			2012. He reported that together with the above working an increase 
			of 64 kW in the load of new Administration Building was also noted. 
			He said that although the consultant had recommended 20% cushion for 
			future needs, he (KPA) has curtailed it to 10%. This required 
			increase in cable capacity which almost negated the cost reduction 
			in cables which was achieved from elimination of future cushions of 
			the three buildings of NBCL’s scope. He said that the following was 
			the outcome as far as material cost of cables was concerned:<br>
			<br>
			• Previous Cost of Cables: Rs. 23,231,295/-<br>
			• Revised Cost of Cables: Rs. 22,827,790/-<br>
			• Decrease in Cost of Cables: Rs. 403,505/-.<br>
			<br>
			2.3 Mr. Khalid Pervez said that the overall reduction in the cost 
			would be as under:<br>
			<br>
			• Previous Total Cost of Works: Rs. 123,334,906/-.<br>
			• Revised Total Cost of Works: Rs. 122,931,401/-.<br>
			<br>
			2.4 He said that if IBA gets 22% discount on cables, the revised 
			total cost of work shall be Rs.117,909,287/-. He said that his 
			professional opinion is that no further room of cost reduction is 
			possible in the way of providing a safe and sound infrastructure 
			network capable of serving this prestigious institution over the 
			next many decades.<br>
			<br>
			2.5 The Registrar suggested to provide the UPS at the Lab only and 
			remove other UPS’s from offices of Academic Block so that the 
			electrical load is further reduced. The Dean &amp; Director wanted to 
			know as to what would be the impact on the load factor as well as on 
			cost saving if the number of UPS is reduced from four to one. He 
			said that even in Students Centre UPS is not needed except one for 
			the lab. He clarified that IBA has reached an understanding with 
			KESC that there would be zero load shedding at IBA. He said that UPS 
			would be needed in worst case scenario. The Registrar said that 
			there are 18 offices in the Academic Block; most of these offices 
			would be occupied by the faculty and they would be working on their 
			own laptops so no UPS would be required for their offices. He said 
			that at Aman-CED Building the offices have temporarily been shifted 
			which will go back to the Admin Building. The Dean &amp; Director said 
			that at Admin Block we should have provision for full load but for 
			other buildings the load factor is on the higher side as compared to 
			the actual use; at Students Centre 81% load factor is high and could 
			be brought down to 75% - 70%. He said that if order has been issued 
			for the supply of UPS then it has to be cancelled so that the cost 
			of UPS is saved. <br>
			<br>
			<b>DECISION</b><br>
			<br>
			2.6 The Committee noted and approved the Revised Total Cost of Works 
			as Rs.122,931,401/- with a provision of further reduction to 
			Rs.117,909,287/- after discount on cables to be obtained from 
			Pakistan Cables.<br>
			<br>
			<b>ACTION</b><br>
			<br>
			2.7 The Committee decided that the Director Projects, in 
			consultation with the Director ICT would cancel the Purchase Order 
			for the UPS except for the labs.<br>
			<br>
			2.8 The Director Projects would present the revised total cost of 
			work to the A&amp;FC as a reporting item. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 3 To inspect the mock-up rooms of the faculty offices at 
			the third floor of Admin. Building. </b> <br>
			<br>
			3.1 The Committee inspected the mock-up rooms prepared for the 
			faculty at the third floor of Admin. Building. The Dean &amp; Director 
			suggested that the size of the faculty offices should be the same as 
			that of Aman-CED building. <br>
			<br>
			3.2 The Committee enquired about the provision of shelves on the 
			wall, to which the Architect assured that he has designed the selves 
			in each room. The Committee was apprised that there are two sizes of 
			faculty rooms available in the Admin Block. One size is almost equal 
			to the room sizes of Aman CED which can accommodate two faculty 
			members and also the same size rooms which are designated for single 
			senior faculty members. The other smaller rooms are for one faculty 
			member in each room.<br>
			<br>
			<b>DECISION</b><br>
			<br>
			3.3 The Committee showed its satisfaction over the quality and 
			design of mock-up rooms.<br>
			<br>
			There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a vote 
			of thanks to the Chair. <br>
