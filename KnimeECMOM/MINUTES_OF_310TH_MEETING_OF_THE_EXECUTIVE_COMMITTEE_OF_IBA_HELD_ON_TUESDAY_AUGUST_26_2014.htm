<font face="Verdana" size="2">1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dean &amp; Director said that earlier we 
set objectives of all departments and along with that we prepared KPS. However, 
over the time it was realized that further differentiation was needed. For 
example, those which are purely service units should have KPIs to determine the 
satisfaction level of those whom they serve.&nbsp; Although we have got AC Nielson 
survey for the last four years yet it is broad based.&nbsp; He said that he thought 
that we should focus the survey of AC Nielson for those departments where we 
have to measure KPIs and the rest ought to be dropped. &nbsp;For each department 
there should be different KPI depending upon their objectives; some will be done 
through evaluation and some will have quantitative measures. The vision, mission 
and objective of the institute and the objectives of the service units should be 
aligned together. He said that major units are admin department, which include 
general administration, facilities management, residence management, security, 
transport.&nbsp; For security the evaluation will be different and not confined to 
students response only as compared to transport department. Along with the 
evaluation of the services, it will also be evaluated whether they have been 
able to control the cost, if the expenses have exceeded the budget or remained 
within the budget etc.&nbsp; In that way we may design the objectives and KPIs 
because currently that is not reflected in the KPIs. The service units were 
asked to do cost saving which some of them did (reduction in electricity bills 
for example) but it is not reflected in the KPI. He said that it is very 
necessary that we set KPIs and objectives of every department and unit anew. Now 
we can link the survey results of AC Nielson with KPI and performance 
evaluation. </font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: #282828">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Zaffar 
A. Khan said that generally what worked well that once a year every department 
manager was given goals and targets of which some were tangible and some were 
intangible. It used to be a formal presentation. Then they had to use judgment, 
selected those which were absolutely critical and important and then would 
discuss and disseminate the selected objectives and KPIs so that everybody knows 
it. Those KPIs&nbsp; of various departments is submitted to the HOD and after 
discussion a pyramid is set. As far as measures are concerned, he said that 
there are many other things for which you have to use perception type feedback 
or 360 degree feedback. He hoped that that type of process is being followed at 
IBA.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: #282828">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dean &amp; 
Director said that we have done this in the context of the strategic plan for 
which we had given KPIs and reported to the Board after every six month. &nbsp;Those 
KPIs were focused on physical infrastructure, IT, faculty development, and HR 
policies. Now we are in a different phase altogether. Now it is maintenance of 
existing facilities, academic excellence, development of managerial pool for 
which there has to be objectives and KPIs. There has to be synchronization among 
the objectives of the institution, of the department and of the units and all 
should be consistent. This is missing in this institution. &nbsp;Everybody is working 
in silos. He said that he wants to get rid of that culture and foster team work. 
We have to have the structure which facilitates communication and flow of 
information so that there is a team work and synergy.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

would not be a radical shift. The Dean &amp; Director said that he is open to it.&nbsp; 
Mr. Zaffar A. Khan said that he would present it in the strategy paper.&nbsp; The 
Dean &amp; Director asked if we should wait for the strategy document 2020 or carry 
on. Mr. Zaffar A. Khan suggested not to hold up and keep working along the line 
because there may be further discussion on the paper. </span></font></p>

standard for internal organization. Dr. Amber Gul said that there are two or 
three standards; one of them is the relations among faculty, staff and 
administration and how they are supporting each other.&nbsp; She said that in this 
area we need to focus on.&nbsp; Mr. Zaffar A. Khan said that we need to make sure 
that there is an interaction between the faculty and administration and work as 
a team as both have important roles to play. </span></font></p>

for only those departments whose KPIs are to be considered. Mr. Zaffar A. Khan 
said that one of the feedbacks that he has received is that faculty and admin 
are disconnected at IBA. Mr. Zaffar A. Khan asked if we hold town hall meetings.

with administration and faculty jointly which he will do. </span></font></p>

summarized and bring the final one to the EC for consideration and approval.&nbsp;

why we need 48 ACs to be shifted when the ACs at IT would remain in place. 
Moreover, the offices of H.R., Audit, EMBA will be shifted to the Admin Block 
when ready. The ACs of these offices need not be shifted; they would become 
redundant. He further said that out of Rs.478,711/- a sum of Rs.300,000/- is 
required for shifting of ACs.&nbsp; If the number of ACs to be shifted is reduced, 
the cost would also come down. &nbsp;He requested the Registrar to visit the MP
