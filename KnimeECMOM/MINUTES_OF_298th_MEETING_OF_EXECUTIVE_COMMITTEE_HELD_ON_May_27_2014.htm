				Mr. Mohammad Anwar, Head Librarian attended the meeting on 
				special invitation.<br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No.1 To consider and approve the agreement of M/s. 
				Icon for preparation of design, tender documents, engineers’ 
				estimate and detailed supervision of external development works 
				at City Campus.</b></u> <br>
				<br>
				1.1 The Director Projects reported that in the year 2012, the 
				Executive Committee desired that the Master Plan of the City 
				Campus be prepared by M/s. ICON as they had renovated and 
				provided their top supervision on the following projects at City 
				Campus: <br>
				<br>
				• Academic Block<br>
				• FCS Building <br>
				• Administration Building <br>
				• Canteen and Lounge for students<br>
				<br>
				1.2 In its meeting held on October 8, 2012, M/s. ICON presented 
				the conceptual Master Plan for consideration of Executive 
				Committee. As desired by the Executive Committee, the revised 
				Master Plan was presented by M/s. ICON to EC in its 275th 
				Meeting held on 25th November 2013. The Executive Committee 
				approved the revised Master Plan after recording many comments 
				of Executive Committee which are to be incorporated in the plan. 
				The Executive Committee in principle had appointed the 
				Consultant M/s. ICON based on their expertise and their work 
				done at the City Campus and that they had already done major 
				works and development of conceptual and schematic design of the 
				Master Plan. The Director Projects said that it is necessary 
				that their appointment be regularized along with their agreement 
				since it is based on direct contracting principles. <br>
				<br>
				1.3 The Director Projects said that M/s. ICON were requested to 
				submit their agreement on this work. They had submitted the same 
				vide their letter dated 3rd September 2013. They had demanded 
				for a lump sum fee of Rs.3,156,000/- (including taxes), for 
				designing, preparation of tender documents and top Supervision. 
				The estimated cost of the External Development project is about 
				Rs.50 million. The percentage M/s Icon are demanding comes to 
				about 6.0% (including taxes). He said that up till now we have 
				been paying them a fee of 5.85% on the projects for their 
				services comprising the designing, tender documentation and top 
				supervision. This project being a smaller one, fee was 
				negotiated with them for carrying out, in addition to their 
				services, the detailed supervision also within the same fee M/s. 
				Icon have agreed to this arrangement. That would dispense with 
				the need for project managers and result in saving of the extra 
				cost that we would have paid to external Project Managers (which 
				have been employed on other projects) to the tune of at least 
				3%. As such the fee payable comes to 3.0% (instead of 5.85% 
				which they have been charging us) for the designing, tender 
				documentation, top supervision and 3% for detailed supervision.<br>
				<br>
				1.4 The Director Projects said that the above arrangement is 
				universally accepted wherein the Architects carry out the 
				detailed supervision and Construction Management. He said that 
				he has provided three annexures; Annexure I provides their main 
				offer whereas Annexure II provides the details of the detailed 
				supervision services to be provided to IBA. Annexure III 
				provides the extension letter of the services agreement of ICON 
				on 3 Projects on the same terms and conditions which were duly 
				approved by the Audit and Finance Committee. He said that the 
				assignment under consideration is not the extension but a new 
				form of contract wherein we are asking the Architects to provide 
				Detailed Supervision of the Project. He said that if it is 
				treated as a repeat order the percent increase is 6% over the 
				fee of Rs.47 million paid to them on the project cost of Rs.808 
				million which is well within 15%. He provided details of the 
				projects of IBA done by M/s ICON. He requested the Executive 
				Committee to approve the appointment of Architects M/s. ICON and 
				their fee structure as above.<br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know if the external 
				development work / Master Planning of City Campus is included in 
				the original agreement with ICON. The Director Projects after 
				getting it verified from his department confirmed that the scope 
				of work as specified in the original agreement included external 
				development work at City Campus. <br>
				<br>
				1.6 The Dean &amp; Director suggested to limit the fee to 5.85% and 
				split into two components; half of 5.85% for detailed 
				supervision as we are not going to hire Project Manager, and 
				half for supervision including designing, preparation of tender 
				documents. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				1.7 The Committee approved the extension in agreement of M/s. 
				ICON for preparation of design, tender documents, engineer’s 
				estimate and detailed supervision of external development works 
				at City Campus. The 5.85% fee to be divided into two components; 
				half of 5.85% for detailed supervision, and half for preparation 
				of design, tender documents, engineer’s estimate etc.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No.2 To consider and approve the cost and Time line 
				of Technology Centre. </b></u><br>
				<br>
				2.1 The Director Projects reported that on May 19, 2014, a 
				detailed inspection of Ground Floor of Multi-purpose Building 
				was conducted by him, his team, the Head of ICT and his team in 
				order to finalize the planning of ‘Technology Centre’ on the 
				ground floor of Multipurpose Building. He said that the earlier 
				planning from the Registrar had to be reviewed and adjusted to 
				accommodate the server room. He said that the Head of ICT agreed 
				that the design prepared by M/s. NESPAK had to be implemented in 
				order to have proper server room and its services like cooling 
				equipment, fire alarm system, fire suppression system and 
				electrical system.<br>
				<br>
				2.2 The Director Projects further informed the Committee that 
				the basic planning of civil and interior work on the areas other 
				than the server room on the ground floor has been done. This 
				work can be combined with the civil work of the interior of the 
				1st floor. However, the server room work being a speciality job 
				is to be tendered separately to speciality contractors on 
				turnkey basis. This will require a period of six months, which 
				will include tendering process and import of cooling equipment. 
				As such the ground floor will be ready by end November 2014.<br>
				<br>
				2.3 The Director Projects reported that the cost of the server 
				room is estimated at Rs.10 million and the estimate for the 
				interior civil works for Ground Floor and First Floor is being 
				prepared. He said that as the First Floor and Ground is fully 
				occupied they need to create alternate space for occupants to 
				move partially either to other places or wait for the permanent 
				relocation of occupants to Administration Building in September 
				2014. He requested the Executive Committee to approve the cost 
				estimate of Server Room and its construction time line.<br>
				<br>
				2.4 The Dean &amp; Director said that the estimate of Rs.10 million 
				is too high as we are not setting up the technology centre de 
				novo. We are simply moving the servers to the ground floor main 
				hall. The Registrar also said that all the equipments, hardware 
				and power supply are in place and the cooling equipment, fire 
				alarm system, fire suppression system and electrical system 
				should not require such a large amount. Mr. Imran Batada said 
				that the major expenditure is on electrical items. He said that 
				he wanted to place tender for electrical work and cooling system 
				separately so that the work can be done at a minimum cost but he 
				said that he has no expertise in these fields. However, he said 
				that as they have got good exposure they may take care of 
				networking. He said that he had initially budgeted Rs.5 million 
				for such work to be carried out on turn key basis. However, he 
				said that to let out and supervise other works he would need 
				cooperation from Admin Department. The Registrar while assuring 
				full cooperation from the Admin suggested that Mr. Mushtaque can 
				be involved in the electrical work. He suggested that for 
				cooling they can procure four floor standing ACs. He said that 
				for cooling, fire detection and fire suppression Rs.5 million 
				should suffice. He advised to issue tender for each work 
				separately in coordination with Mr. Mushtaque. <br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Director Projects presented the layout of the ground 
				floor of the MP Building (which is to be named as NBP Technology 
				Centre). He said that the server room, battery room, power 
				centre all will be accommodated on the ground floor and the 
				general store will occupy the space where ICT procurement staff 
				is currently sitting. The ICT procurement staff will be moved to 
				the first floor. The Director Projects said that they will be 
				able to make two floors of the Admin Building operational by 
				July 15, 2014 when some offices of MP Building can be shifted. 
				The Registrar suggested that first the program office should be 
				shifted to the Admin. Building when the floor is ready. The wall 
				in the Computer lab of MP Building should be removed. 
				Simultaneously new computer desks and chairs should be ordered 
				for the 20 computer stations to be added to the existing labs.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.6 The Registrar said that they had physically visited and 
				checked the size of the existing store and realized that they 
				would require more space. The Registrar said that the space 
				allocated for storage of spares, and offices for store staff was 
				insufficient. He proposed that the existing store rooms along 
				the boundary wall and south of the under-construction workshop 
				block may be retained. The Director Projects said that he had 
				visited the site and found that this was possible but involved 
				re-routing of the bulk water line and risk involved when rocks 
				will be cut just next to the building which is not a framed 
				structure. Works to strengthen the existing room as well as 
				improve their facade to match it with surroundings will be 
				required.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				2.7 The Committee approved Rs.5 million for the cooling 
				equipment, fire alarm system, fire suppression system, 
				electrical system, IP Phone and internet work and other allied 
				work at the Technology Centre. <br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				2.8 The Head of ICT in coordination with Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed 
				would issue tenders for each work separately and ensure that the 
				work is completed and the Technology Centre is ready by end of 
				November 2014. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No. 3 To review the conceptual design of the Gateway 
				to IBA Main Campus. </b></u><br>
				<br>
				3.1 The Director Projects presented the design of the Gateway to 
				IBA Main Campus as prepared by NBCL. According to the design the 
				exit and entrance were at the same place. The Dean &amp; Director 
				said that in order to maintain smooth flow of traffic, the exit 
				and entrance should be from Gate #1 and Gate # 4 respectively. 
				He asked the Director Projects to have a meeting with Mr. Zayed 
				and explain our requirement and location. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Item No. 4 Institutional Pay Contract with Harvard Business 
				School Publications for Case Method Teaching for MBA Program.
				<br>
				<br>
				4.1 Mr. Mohammad Anwar said that as there is shift in pedagogy 
				from lecture-base to case method in MBA. He said that the HBSP – 
				IBA Institutional Pay Contract, will ensure the provision of 
				Cases to the faculty and will have following benefits:<br>
				<br>
				• Globally acclaimed pedagogy adopted by top business schools.<br>
				• IBA will join the group of HBS Partner Institutes.<br>
				• Access to network support for training, development, and 
				capacity building.<br>
				• Access to robust course and teaching contents including

				• Will enhance MBA program competitiveness and thus of the 
				graduates.<br>
				• Pay the way to international accreditations – AACSB<br>
				• Shun the use of illegal and unethical teaching contents.<br>
				<br>
				4.2 Mr. Anwar said that there are two modules; Standard Course 
				Pack, and Extended Course Pack. Standard Course pack includes 
				unlimited access to the following content at a fixed fee:<br>

				• Case Analysis Coach (a comprehensive, concise student tutorial 
				for analysing, discussing and writing about cases)<br>
				<br>
				The Extended Course Pack includes the content covered in 
				Standard Course Pack. In addition, available partner schools’ 
				case collections, articles and book chapters will also be 
				available. <br>
				<br>
				4.3 Mr. Anwar said that 18 online simulations and seven online 
				courses are also available in the areas of Finance, Marketing, 
				Operations &amp; Service Management, Organizational Behavior, and 
				Strategy. Dr. Sayeed Ghani asked Mr. Anwar to give a proposal as 
				to which simulations we should acquire. He also wanted to know 
				as to how many simulations faculty members are using currently. 
				Mr. Anwar said that program-wise commercials for Site License

				4.4 Mr. Anwar said that if they go for Extended License @$89 per 
				student per year for 350 MBA students, it would cost US$31,150/- 
				He said that if this amount is charged to the students, it would 
				cost Rs.9000/- per student/year. Mr. Anwar said that in last two 
				years they purchased 324 cases from different sources for which 
				they had to pay US$12,000. The Dean &amp; Director said that the 
				number of students in MBA program is less than 350; it may be 
				180. He said that initially we can provide this facility for the 
				MBA Morning Program only. He said that first year IBA will pay 
				the license fee and next year we may consider whether to charge 
				the students depending upon its effectiveness and attraction. He 
				further said that since all teachers are not teaching case 
				studies, we do not need all the cases. Mr. Anwar said that the 
				Program Coordinator can design the curriculum in a way that case 
				studies are also covered. <br>
				<br>
				4.5 The Registrar said that at LUMS there is an LCD which 
				displays the services and journals that are available in their 
				library. He suggested that similar type of LCD displaying the 
				relevant information should be placed in our new library. The 
				Committee appreciated the idea of the Registrar.<br>
				<br>
				4.6 Mr. Mohammad Anwar said that the following may be the 
				challenges on shifting from text book and lecture based method 
				to case method teaching:<br>
				<br>
				• Understanding the pedagogical shift from textbook to case 
				method teaching.<br>
				• Adoption / Curriculum Development / Training<br>
				• Ownership of the key stakeholders (faculty and students).<br>
				• Overall course-load, as case method is requires more rigor 
				than textbook (mainly based on lectures)<br>
				• Physical facilities pertinent to case method teaching<br>
				• Financial or budgetary provisions<br>
				<br>
				4.7 The Dean &amp; Director said that the License fee will be paid 
				from the Library Budget. He said that Rs.10 million has been 
				allocated for the Library out of which the License fee should be 
				paid. He asked the Head Librarian to prioritise the access by 
				including value resources like HBP Cases and unsubscribing less 
				used resources. He said that the Program Director MBA will have 
				to work hard on shifting from lecture/textbook based teaching to 
				case method teaching. He suggested that Dr. Nishat and Dr. Nasir 
				Afghan should give a presentation to the MBA faculty to motivate 
				them to incorporate Case Method. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				4.8 The Committee approved the Institutional Pay Contract with 
				Harvard Business School Publications for Case Method Teaching 
				for MBA Morning Program. <br>
				<br>
				4.9 Mr. Muhammad Anwar will give presentation to MBA core group 
				about the scope and modalities of IBA-HBP partnership. Dr. 
				Mohammad Nishat and Dr. Nasir Afghan would discuss with the 
				faculty in faculty meetings for the revision of course contents 
				of MBA program accordingly to incorporate Case Method Teaching.<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair.<br>
