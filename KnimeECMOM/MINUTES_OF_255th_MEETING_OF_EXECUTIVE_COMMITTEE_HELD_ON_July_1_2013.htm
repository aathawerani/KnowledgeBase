				<span lang="en-gb"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Item No. 1 
				To consider and approve the Laptop Ownership Policy.</b><br>
				<br>
				1.1 Mr. Imran Batada said that he has prepared the Laptop 
				Ownership / Issuance Policy and also incorporated the 
				suggestions from HR &amp; Finance. The Director H.R. said that when 
				the new faculty whose laptop was to be issued were conveyed the 
				decision of the 252nd meeting of the Executive Committee held on 
				June 10, 2013 that the ownership of the laptop would be 
				transferred to them on payment of 50% of the cost in 36 
				instalments, a few faculty members were uncomfortable with this 
				decision. <br>
				<br>
				1.2 To a question from the Director Projects, Mr. Imran Batada 
				said that if HOD is given a new laptop in replacement then 50% 
				payment will apply to him/her also. Dr. Mohammad Nishat wanted 
				to know if a faculty member does not want to keep ownership for 
				three years, then how such cases should be treated. Mr. Imran 
				Batada said that there is no option given by the Dean &amp; 
				Director. <br>
				<br>
				1.3 Dr. Sayeed Ghani wanted to know as to what is the cost of a 
				laptop and how many laptops are required to be purchased. Mr. 
				Imran Batada said that 75 new laptops are required and the cost 
				of a lap is around Rs.60,000/- Thus around Rs.4.5 million would 
				be required out of which 50% would be recovered from the faculty 
				in three years time. <br>
				<br>
				1.4 Dr. Mohammad Nishat suggested that in view of the feedback 
				of faculty, the Dean &amp; Director may be requested to give option 
				to the faculty either to take the ownership of the laptop or 
				not. <br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Director H.R. said that for the existing laptop, faculty 
				will be given an option of buying back at the existing market 
				value but they will not be given replacement. A representative 
				from IT and Finance would assess the market value. Dr. Sayeed 
				Ghani suggested that the market price should be assessed on the 
				basis of sale price not on purchase price. <br>
				<br>
				1.6 Mr. Imran Batada said that this is the right time to replace 
				Toshiba Laptops with HP as there SLA for Toshiba has already 
				expired but SLA with HP is still valid. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				1.7 The Committee asked Mr. Imran Batada to present the policy 
				again to the EC supported by the discussions as a 
				recommendation. <br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>
				<br>
				1.8 Mr. Imran Batada would present the policy again along with 
				the recommendations made above. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 To consider and approve the extension of time 
				period of the project “Visiting Faculty Hostel”. </b><br>
				<br>
				2.1 Mr. Shakeel Anwar, Engineer, HEC Projects, reported that the 
				construction of Visiting Faculty Hostel started on 1st December 
				2011 and its completion date was 30th November 2012. The first 
				extension for completing the project was given to the Contractor 
				for six Months starting from 1st December 2012 to 31st May 2013. 
				But Contractor was unable to complete the project due to the 
				following changes by Architect and approval of cost impact by 
				Project Manager:<br>
				<br>
				• Staircase Terrazzo steps replaced by Silbatta Stone.<br>
				• Door polish approval.<br>
				• Water Spout Cost impact <br>
				• Door Hardware Cost Impact<br>
				• Anti shatter Film and Frosted Film Cost Impact.<br>
				• Change of Aluminium Windows colour<br>
				• Kitchen Cost Impact<br>
				• Fire House Cabinet SS panel Cost Impact<br>
				<br>
				2.2 Mr. Shakeel stated that the Contractor Al Shafi Enterprises 
				submitted a letter dated 25th April for 2nd extension for four 
				months. A meeting of Architect, Project Managers, client and 
				contractor was held on June 6, 2013 regarding 2nd Extension 
				issue. After a brief discussion Project Manager, Architect and 
				Client agreed on 2.5 months extension. <br>
				<br>
				2.3 Mr. Shakeel requested the EC to approve a second extension 
				of 2.5 months i.e. till August 15, 2013 in the time of 
				completion of the project. He reported that the CPC has 
				recommended second extension in time in the meeting held on June 
				29, 2013.<br>
				<br>
				2.4 The Director Projects said that he has assessed it and it is 
				possible to complete the project by August 15, 2013. However, he 
				said that they cannot afford any changes in the design. <br>
				<br>
				2.5 Dr. Mohammad Nishat said that there are termites in the 
				campus. He suggested to make treatment for termites specially in 
				wooden work. The Director Projects said that treatment for 
				termites would be done. Dr. Nishat further said that in 
				September this year two or three professors from Germany would 
				be coming who would be provided accommodation at the VPR. He 
				requested that it should be ensured that the project is 
				completed by August 15, 2013.<br>
				<br>
				2.6 The Director Projects said that sewerage and landscaping 
				work has not been awarded as yet but it would be ordered if the 
				proposal presented separately is approved by the EC. However, he 
				requested not to provide accommodation to foreigners until the 
				external work is completed which is expected to be completed by 
				November this year. <br>
				<br>
				2.7 Mr. Moeid Sultan wanted to know if there is any cost impact 
				because of extension. The Director Projects replied that the CPC 
				has approved 2.5 months extension on the condition that if the 
				project is not completed in 2.5 months i.e. by August 15, 2013, 
				the original 6 months plus 2.5 months = 8.5 months penalty would 
				be imposed. However, he said that escalation is the part of the 
				contract which we have to give. The Consultant pointed out that 
				the escalation is allowed on cement and steel which have already 
				been used and completed. Other items are not included in the 
				contract.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.8 The Committee approved the extension in completion of 
				Visiting Faculty Hostel project for 2.5 months i.e. till August 
				15, 2013, failing which as recommended by CPC 8½ months penalty 
				would be imposed on the Contractor. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.3 Approval of Variation Order of Miscellaneous 
				Sewerage Works at Visiting Faculty Hostel. </b><br>
				<br>
				3.1 The Director Projects stated that the External Sewerage 
				System of the Visiting Faculty Hostel was not in the scope of 
				the work of the Architects. Lately, when the building’s own 
				sewerage system had been constructed and levels were known, M/s. 
				Najmi Bilgrami Collaborative (NBCL) were asked to send the 
				drawings for the external sewerage system. This was not 
				constructed earlier as the work outside the periphery of the 
				building was not available. As the construction machinery and 
				material have been removed, the work can be done now.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Director Projects said that as the Visiting Faculty 
				Hostel is to be handed over to the Management for occupation by 
				the moving in faculty from abroad, it was considered essential 
				that the work could be made part of existing work in the 
				building. This would save the mobilization and de-mobilization 
				of a new contractor and also avoid the clash of two contractors 
				at one site. Secondly, the urgency of work is quite evident from 
				the above. He reported that in this regard BOQ was prepared by 
				the HEC Projects Department and given to the existing 
				contractors M/s. Al-Shafi Enterprises with the request to quote 
				their rates of these items. They have submitted their quotations 
				of Rs.2.58 million. All the rates were scrutinized by the 
				Engineers &amp; Quantity Surveyors of HEC Projects Department and 
				subsequently by the Sr. Quantity Surveyor of Projects 
				Department. The Contractors were invited to accept the reduced 
				cost which was at Rs.2.074 million and over &amp; above they were 
				asked to give further rebate. They had offered a rebate of 5% 
				and final cost would be Rs.1.971 million. The Director Projects 
				confirmed that the amount of variation order is within 15% of 
				the project cost. <br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Director Projects reported that the Central Purchase 
				Committee in its meeting held on June 29, 2013 has approved the 
				amount of Rs.1,971,193/- for miscellaneous Sewerage works at 
				Visiting Faculty Hostel.<br>
				<br>
				3.4 Mr. Moeid suggested that the Contractor should deploy 
				additional resources in order to complete the project on time. 
				Mr. Jawed Islam, Project Engineer confirmed that the contractors 
				would deploy additional resources. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.5 The Committee approved the Variation Order for Miscellaneous 
				Sewerage Works at Visiting Faculty Hostel at a cost of 
				Rs.1,971,193/- to the existing contractor M/s. Al-Shafi 
				Enterprises.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 4 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.</b><br>
				<br>
				a) Ex-Post Facto approval for Maintenance Works.<br>
				<br>
				4.1 Syed Fahim Uddin, Manager General Maintenance / Security 
				stated that the activities of the Facilities Maintenance 
				Department include immediate maintenance requirements in 
				addition to the regular planned activities. Due to the heavy 
				work load resulting because of currently underway construction, 
				all the facilities are heavily booked and therefore periodical 
				maintenance is done only during the semester breaks. This 
				creates frequent urgent client requests to do maintenance work 
				while classes are on. Maintenance Department has to take care of 
				such urgent requests speedily through any available vendor and 
				contractor. He reported that during FY 2012-13 various 
				maintenance jobs requested by Building In-Charges have been 
				completed on urgent need basis. These were executed / completed 
				through available contractors after completing due process. 
				However, Finance Department approval was initiated afterwards 
				due to urgency in majority of the works. He requested the 
				Executive Committee to grant EX-Post Facto approval to settle 
				those Bills of contractors (14 altogether amounting to 
				Rs.898,155/-) before closing of Current Financial Year.<br>
				<br>
				4.2 Syed Fahim Uddin said that due to urgency of work they 
				skipped some of the procedural requirements and awarded the 
				work. However, he said that all bills are available. He assured 
				that in future he would ensure that the due process is completed 
				before award of the work. He said that there was no item which 
				would have required tendering. He said that there was only item 
				for which splitting orders were issued and that was due to under 
				estimation of the requirement of the material. He said that 
				there were only three days available for laying and fixing of 
				tiles, painting and white washing of ICT Computer Lab. At the 
				last moment tile fixing bond became short, therefore the same 
				vendor was asked to provide the material from local market as 
				the Maintenance staff was too busy to procure it at a very short 
				notice. <br>
				<br>
				4.3 Dr. Muhammad Nishat suggested that there should be a system 
				whereby such problems may not come up again. Mr. Moeid Sultan 
				said that the Dean &amp; Director has the emergency power which he 
				can exercise but it has to be a real urgency. He said that the 
				Dean &amp; Director had wanted to discuss the justifications of each 
				one of the 14 items. Syed Fahim Uddin reported that the 
				Registrar had discussed with the Dean &amp; Director and then the 
				Dean &amp; Director advised to place the matter before the EC.<br>
				<br>
				4.4 Mr. Moeid Sultan suggested that in the largest interest of 
				IBA and to save the image of IBA in the market, EC should 
				regularize the maintenance work carried out in urgency and grant 
				ex-post facto approval.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				4.5 The Committee granted ex-post factor approval for the work 
				carried out in urgency. The total amount involved is 
				Rs.898,155/- <br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair.</font></span></p>
