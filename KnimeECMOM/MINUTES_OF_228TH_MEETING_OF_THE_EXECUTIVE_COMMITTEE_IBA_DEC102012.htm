			Mr.Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects, Mr.Ishfaque Ahmed Lashari, 
			Assistant Manager, CDC, and Mr. Khalid Pervez of KP Associates 
			attended on special invitation.<br>
			<br>
			The following items were discussed: <br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.1 Status Reports from:<br>
			<br>
			Dr. Muhammad Nishat:</b><br>
			<br>
			<b>1.1 Case of Mr. Abdul Rafai:</b> The Committee was informed that the 
			case of Mr. Abdul Rafai has been resolved and no correction was 
			required to be made in the grade.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.2 Request from a student for pre-ponement of final exam - Dr. 
			Muhammad Nishat to tell the student that the student would be given 
			‘I” in the final exam:</b> The Committee was informed that the decision 
			was conveyed to the student by Dr.Nishat.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Director Projects&amp; Director HEC Projects:</b><br>
			<br>
			<b>1.3 Placement of 20 watts Ceiling Mounted Speakers with supporting 
			equipments at the cafeteria, dining hall and the gym: </b>The Director 
			Projects informed the Committee that the Purchase Order has been 
			issued within the cost of Rs.182,200/-, as approved by the Executive 
			Committee.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.4 The Director Projects to provide the list of pre-qualified 
			consultants to Mr.Shameem Ahmed. IBA may arrange a competition among 
			the pre-qualified consultants for the faculty apartment 
			project: </b>Mr.Shameem Ahmed reported that a Request for Proposals (RFP) 
			has been issued to all pre-qualified consultants whose list was 
			provided by the Director Projects. The RFP takes care of (a) the 
			covered area aspect, (b) improvement of design, and (c) a 
			competition among the consultants. The extended last date for 
			receiving the proposals is December 15, 2012.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.5 Ms. Sana Tanveer to redesign Block - 3 for three bed room 
			apartments so that the covered area does not exceed 2500 
			sft.: </b>Mr.Shameem Ahmed said that as reported above, the RFP includes 
			improvement of design within the specified area and a competition 
			among the consultants.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.6 Mr.Shameem Ahmed to obtain auto cad drawings of both the phases 
			of girls’ hostel from the Consultant: </b>Mr.Shameem Ahmed reported that 
			the drawings have been obtained.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.7 Incorporation of suggestions in the Master Plan of City Campus:</b> 
			The Director Projects reported that the suggestions given by the EC 
			have been communicated to the Architects for compliance.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.8 Procurement, installation, testing and commissioning of 400 KVA 
			Diesel Engine Generator for new Girls’ Hostel:</b> Mr. Shameem Ahmed 
			reported that a Letter of Acceptance has been issued to Orient 
			Energy System (Pvt.) Ltd. on October 31, 2012. <br>
			<br>
			<b>1.9 The Director Projects in coordination with the Registrar would 
			arrange the</b> kitchen/<b>counters for operating four vendors:</b> The 
			Director Projects reported that Physical Construction which was 
			possible is in progress. He said that the Registrar had suggested 
			that there should be a combined exhaust but it is not possible / 
			advisable because if at any stage one or two of the exhausts are 
			closed the energy of the single big fan will be wasted. As such it 
			has been proposed by the Consultants that independent exhaust fans 
			will be provided to provide flexibility of use as well as to 
			conserve the energy. <br>
			<br>
			The Registrar said that he has emailed to the Director Projects on 
			December 1, 2012 the requirements of utilities for storage, 
			preparation, cooking, and service equipment in the kitchens. He said 
			that the counter of the outlet is very high because of which the 
			display of food stuff may not be so prominent. The Director Projects 
			said that he would check the height of the counter and take the 
			standard one. The Registrar suggested that each of the four kitchens 
			must have IP phone facility, points for electronic cash register and 
			gas connection. <br>
			<br>
			Mr.Shameem Ahmed informed the Committee that they are not getting 
			gas from SSGC for the time being. The Registrar said that they have 
			to arrange LPG cylinders if gas is not available. The Registrar 
			requested the Director Projects to arrange conduits for the LPG and 
			electricity load of 35 amps (three phase) for the kitchen equipment.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Registrar reported that he contacted the vendors including KFC 
			but none of them have committed because running an outlet at IBA is 
			not financially viable for them. Therefore, instead of vendor 
			specific he recommended that the kitchens be generic ones. Each 
			kitchen would be divided into two parts; rear which will be 
			functionary area accommodating de-freezer, storage, bottle cooler 
			and garbage storage, and the serving area i.e. the counter. He felt 
			that bulk cooking cannot be done at the kitchen because of space 
			constraints. The Director Projects said that Mr.ZafarSiddiqui had 
			suggested that all the cooking should be done in the kitchen. He 
			requested the EC to confirm whether bulk cooking would be done in 
			the kitchen or not. He said that the EC had decided that there would 
			be four different vendors with different food items but now EC is 
			told that none of the proposed vendors are coming and now the 
			kitchen would be a generic one, which any food vendor could take and 
			improvise / amend / alter at own cost to meet any specific 
			requirements that the same vendor may have. <br>
			<br>
			The Director Projects gave the example of the properly designed 
			kitchen built by Projects Department in the City Campus based on the 
			requirements of the canteen. Once it was completed the PEPSI 
			bottlers visited and got it completely changed because of which 
			cooking had to be taken out for which a special cooking room was 
			built separately. <br>
			<br>
			The Director Projects stated that the original design of the 
			Students’ Centre Kitchen was changed into 4 kitchens and again the 
			the usage of the four kitchens is not known as no vendor is coming. 
			He further pointed out that there was no cooking facility in the 
			AMAN-CED and as such it is imperative that the kitchens should have 
			proper place for cooking which will require floor mounted burners as 
			done in the hostel for cooking. He reiterated that EC should 
			establish what is needed as the end products from the kitchens to 
			serve the mixed users. In the absence of any defined usage power and 
			gas requirements cannot be worked out.<br>
			<br>
			The Registrar insisted that there was no major change and he had 
			provided all the inputs required. Now since the Director Projects 
			was not satisfied with the information gathered; the Registrar 
			requested the EC members to allow him to dis-associate himself with 
			the kitchen related matters and leave it in the hands of the 
			Director Projects and Consultants who could better solve the 
			queries. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Dr.SayeedGhani suggested that the item related to kitchen planning 
			should be deferred and discussed in the presence of Mr.ZafarSiddiqui 
			and the Dean &amp; Director. <br>
			</b>
			<br>
			<b>1.10 Disposal of Staircase Tower removed from Academic Block, City 
			Campus:</b> The Director Projects reported that no usage of the 
			dismantled staircase tower could be established. All Architects 
			showed their inability to use it. He said that the required 
			formalities for disposal was completed and given to the CPC.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.11 Observations received on the prayer hall:</b> The Director Projects 
			reported that the decisions of the EC have been conveyed to the 
			Architects and they are working on it. Their revised drawings are 
			awaited.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.12 The Director Projects to discuss with the Dean &amp; Director the 
			estimated cost provided for Detailed Design, Electrical 
			infrastructure etc. so that the project is completed at Rs.165 
			million:</b> The Director Projects reported that the matter has been 
			discussed with the Architect and Project Manager to adopt the value 
			engineering during the execution so that the project cost should not 
			exceed Rs.165 million, excluding the cost of elevator. The Director 
			Projects said that he could not discuss it with the Dean and 
			Director. However, he said that he will discuss with the Dean &amp; 
			Director on the first opportunity available.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Director ICT</b><br>
			<br>
			<b>1.13 Action Plan of IBA Strategy Review 2012. The Director ICT to 
			ask Mr. Imran Batada to imbed in the system consistent interaction 
			with the industry electronically.</b> The Director ICT reported that it 
			was in the process but Mr. Imran Batada had to go to read a paper 
			and attend another conference in UK. He will join office from 
			December 10, 2012 and take up this issue.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.14 Procurement of Active Components of FCS Block:</b> The Director ICT 
			reported that tender has been processed and Technical evaluation has 
			been completed. The case has been forwarded to Tech-ICT. After 
			approval it will be forwarded to CPC. <br>

			October 25, 2012:</b> The Director ICT reported that a separate website 
			of IRC has been completed, handed over to IRC and linked with the 
			home page of the IBA website.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.16 Floating tender for the PCs:</b>The Director ICT reported that 
			tender was floated but HP and DELL did not participate due to our 
			rigid payment terms, as our payments are spread over three years. At 
			IBAthe payment schedule usually is consistent with our ERP HW 
			schedule as approved by DF and CPC which is 60% on delivery; 20% one 
			year after delivery; and 20% after two years. However due to the 
			objection raised by HP and DELL the Finance and CPC have approved 
			the following terms:<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			90% on delivery<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			5% after one year<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			5% after two year.<br>
			<br>
			The Director ICT said that after his meeting with HP and DELL, they 
			have agreed to participate in the new tender with very reasonable 
			prices. The quantities of the tender have been revised and will be 
			published between December 15 and 20, 2012.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1.17 The Director ICT to depute IT staff for physical verification 
			of PC’s and other IT related equipments at Girls’ Hostel on monthly 
			basis:</b> The Director ICT reported that two Help desk staff have been 
			deputed to check on monthly basis the equipment at the Girls Hostel 
			against the list of equipment installed and report to the ICT 
			Procurement Manager, if any discrepancy is found. He also presented 
			the inventory check list.<br>

			equipment: </b>The Director ICT reported that the great outcome of his 
			meetings with the Cisco in Dubai is that they have released the 
			entire Cisco order and it has already reached Dubai. Presently the

			shipment to Pakistan. According to Mr.Maroof, CEO of AMFCO, the 
			shipment would reach IBA by December 19, 2012, after clearance form 
			customs and other import authorities. The Director ICT requested the 
			Registrar to provide the suitable storage place to store the 
			equipment at that time.<br>
			<br>
			The Registrar said that he would provide temporary storage space for 
			the equipment at the Tabba Building. <br>
			<br>
			<b>1.19 Progress report on Data Centre Project:</b> The Director ICT 
			reported that the masonry / civil works are proceeding well and are 
			expected to be completed by the end of December 2012. AMFCO will 
			confirm the equipment delivery dates by next week. <br>

			to be operational. The Director ICT replied that by the end of 
			January 2013 the Data Centre would be operational. <br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			_____________________________<br>
			Total estimated cost of the project : Rs.44,598,800/-<br>
			<br>
			3.3 Mr.Shameem Ahmed said that as the Dean &amp; Director wanted to know 
			the justification for asking to include generator and cable costs in 
			this estimate, he has invited Mr. Khalid Pervez, the Consultant to 
			justify his claim.<br>
			<br>
			3.4 Mr. Khalid Pervez in support of his claim said that he had 
			prepared the tender documents, specifications for generator and 
			presented the design to the EC. But the EC said that IBA has some 
			cables which could be used. So he had to redesign the design to 
			incorporate the existing cable. <br>
			<br>
			3.5 Mr.Moeid Sultan said that if the contract price is Rs.29.7 
			million and we have the agreement with KP Associates that we would 
			pay the fee on the contract price, then if we pay the additional 
			fee, there would be audit objection. The Director Projects said that 
			in such caseamendments in the contract can be made. However, it was 
			reported that the contract has not yet been finalized. <br>
			<br>
			3.6 Mr. Khalid Pervez said that if he were told earlier that the two 
			items would not be included then he would not have reduced his fee 
			from 5% to 3%. He said that owner furnished items are always part 
			and parcel of the contract if they are in the design. The 
			installation, commissioning and testing of the generator would still 
			be his responsibility. <br>
			<br>
			<b>DECISION</b><br>
			<br>

			noted in 3.2 above on which 3% fee will be payable to the
