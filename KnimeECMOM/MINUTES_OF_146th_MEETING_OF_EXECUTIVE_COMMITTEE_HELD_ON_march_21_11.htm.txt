 DECISION1.7 The Committee agreed with the Director that there was no need to form special committees as two experts namely Dr. Shakeel Khoja and Mr. M. Faisal Zia are already on the Technical Evaluation Committee who can evaluate and select the Consultant and the Consultant thus selected would help in selecting the Contractors. The Committee allowed the delay of at least 2 to 3 weeks in the process but requested the Director Projects to try to speed up the process of selection of consultants.
