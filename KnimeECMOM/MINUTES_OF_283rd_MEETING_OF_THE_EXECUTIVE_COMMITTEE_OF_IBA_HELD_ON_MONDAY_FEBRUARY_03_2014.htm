		<span lang="en-gb"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dr. M. Shahid Qureshi, Program Director CED attended the meeting on special invitation. <br>
		<br>
		The following items were discussed: <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. <u>1 Proposals from Dr. M. Shahid Qureshi for:</u><br>
		</b><br>
		<b>a) <u>The purchase of Kiosks<br>
		</u></b><br>
		1.1 Dr. Shahid Qureshi before presenting his proposal for the purchase 
		of Kiosk, briefed the members about the activities going on at the 
		Centre for Entrepreneurial Development in the areas of Collaboration / 
		Partnership (national and international), Community Outreach Activities, 
		Entrepreneurial Co-curricular Activities, IBA Incubator, 
		Entrepreneurship Research, Faculty Development, and Entrepreneurship 
		Teaching at IBA. He also highlighted major achievements of CED including 
		the USASBE Outstanding Emerging Entrepreneurship Program Award. He said 
		that there were 50 participants in the USASBE competition which were 
		shortlisted to 4; IBA CED was one of the four. He said that Institute 
		from India with 18 years standing got the first position. He was very 
		optimistic that next year the chances are very high for IBA CED to be 
		number one. The members congratulated Dr. Shahid Qureshi on this great 
		achievement within a short span of three years of the inception of the 
		IBA CED. Dr. Qureshi also apprised the members of the new Projects and 
		the business activities of CED Incubatees. <br>
		<br>
		1.2 Dr. Shahid Qureshi said that students have come up with an idea of 
		plastic made Kiosks. He said that four 4 kiosks are required to 
		accommodate businesses of FME Students because the current activity 
		rooms are completely occupied and the demand of spaces is increasing. He 
		presented the pictures of proposed kiosks which would cost around 
		Rs.110,000 each. He said that the kiosks life may be up to four or five 
		years and the cost may be recovered in two years time by renting them 
		out at Rs.5000/- per month to the users. <br>
		<br>
		1.3 Dr. Shahid Qureshi proposed that Kiosks can be placed on the green 
		belts between the G&amp;T Auditorium and Adamjee Academic Block, in the 
		sunshade area &amp; inside or outside the Alumni Resource Centre. The Dean &amp; 
		Director said that the Kiosks should be located at such a place that 
		they are not needed to be further relocated. He asked the Director 
		Projects to identify the location after seeing the Master Plan so that 
		it may be integrated with the Master Plan and it should be lowest cost 
		operation for which comparative bidding should be done. <br>
		<br>
		1.4 Dr. Shahid Qureshi further suggested that the electricity to these 
		Kiosks should be provided by IBA. The FME students will generally not be 
		charged for the electricity expenses. Alternatively a nominal rent can 
		be charged which will cover the electricity expenses. This will however 
		depend if the business is making some adequate amount of sales or not. 
		These Kiosks will serve as a display room/place, backed by the storage 
		space allotted to occupants for keeping their inventory. The occupants 
		will be given a S.O.P sheet to maintain their Kiosks and they will be 
		penalized at the end of their contract/term in case of any damage done 
		to the Kiosks. Another option is to collect a nominal caution money sum 
		from the occupants before handing over the Kiosks.<br>
		<br>
		1.5 The Registrar said that there are three aspects; physical purchase 
		of Kiosks, its planting and running it. The Dean &amp; Director suggested to 
		connect food items with the canteen. He suggested to consult Mr. Zayad 
		Bilgrami of NBCL so that its aesthetic is not affected. He suggested to 
		involve Dr. Shahid Qureshi and the Registrar in the meeting with Mr. 
		Zayad. The Dean &amp; Director requested the Registrar to place the tender 
		for the Kiosks.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		1.6 The Committee approved the proposal for purchase of four Kiosks for 
		Rs.110,000 each.<br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.7 The Director Projects would arrange a meeting of Dr. Shahid Qureshi 
		and the Registrar with Mr. Zayed of NBCL to finalize the design and 
		integration of the Kiosks (including future requirements) with the 
		Master Plan. They would also select the place where the Kiosks would be 
		placed.<br>
		<br>
		1.8 The Registrar would float tender for the purchase of four plastic 
		Kiosks. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>b) <u>Request for Permission of Lockers at IBA</u><br>
		</b><br>
		1.9 Dr. Shahid Qureshi reported that one of their students (member of 
		FAKAT Team) has sought permission for placing student lockers at IBA 
		under the name of FAKAT, a company that came into existence as part of 
		their course. He clarified that there would be no financial implications 
		on the part of IBA. The lockers would be available 24/7 to the students 
		of Entrepreneurship course. He said that at LUMS and KSBL also lockers 
		are provided to the students. He said that a unit of 12 lockers would 
		require an investment of around Rs.21,000/- which can be recovered in 12 
		months time. The investment on lockers and its management will be done 
		by the students themselves. The Dean &amp; Director said that it is a 
		completely new idea for IBA and we have to try and see if this is 
		successful. He said that since it is on payment basis we have to see as 
		to how many students would use it. He suggested to start with 12 lockers 
		and see if there is demand for more lockers, then increase the number of 
		lockers. Dr. Sayeed Ghani suggested to consider providing such 
		arrangement at City Campus too. The Dean &amp; Director said that at Aman 
		Tower also lockers facility can be provided. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		1.10 The Committee granted permission to the member of FAKAT Team for 
		placing a unit of 12 lockers for the students of Entrepreneurship 
		course.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>c) <u>FME Mentors</u><br>
		</b><br>
		1.11 Dr. Shahid Qureshi said that FME is a heavy course and 40 students 
		have launched their businesses. He said that TAs attached with teachers 
		were mentoring the projects. However as every student wants personal 
		mentoring and in view of the increase in business projects, senior 
		students are engaged as mentors. He proposed that by reducing the number 
		of TAs and replacing them with senior students, they can engage 8 to 10 
		mentors in place of one TA because the cost of one TA would be spread 
		over several mentors. He suggested that senior students engaged as 
		mentors may be given some incentives in the form of payment of @Rs.200/- 
		per hour and a maximum of 5 hours in a week. The Dean &amp; Director asked 
		as to what they would be doing and what their terms of reference would 
		be. Dr. Shahid Qureshi said that there is a complete document for 
		accountability and it would be channelized through H.R. The Dean &amp; 
		Director said that as long as there is a saving on TAs he has no issue. 
		Mr. Adnan Hameed suggested that total number of hours should not exceed 
		20 hours in a week.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		1.12 The Committee approved the proposal of Dr. Shahid Qureshi to engage 
		senior students as mentors by reducing the number of TAs and providing 
		the proposed incentives to the mentors.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.2 <u>To consider proposed changes in Staff Welfare Fund 
		Policy.</u> </b><br>
		<br>
		2.1 Mr. Moeid Sultan said that the existing Staff Welfare Policy was 
		approved in 2010 by the BoG and since then after a lapse of three years 
		there was a need to update the same to account for changes due to the 
		inflation and other reasons. He reported that the policy has been 
		improved in the following areas:<br>
		<br>
		• Scope has been broadened to cover few other areas for grants as well 
		as the loan facility:<br>
		<br>
		o Loans for Marriage will now also be given for the marriage of sister 
		and sons<br>
		o Qarz-e-Hasna facility has been introduced for Higher studies of Self 
		and immediate family members <br>
		o Loan facility of eligible employees will also be given for House 
		Construction, Acquisition.<br>
		<br>
		• Limits have been enhanced keeping in view the inflation factors and 
		also to benefit few other categories of the employees: <br>
		<br>
		o Eligibility to become a member of the fund will now be for employees 
		having salary of Rs.50,000 (earlier it was Rs.40,000)<br>
		o Eligibility for Grants (medical and children education) have been 
		increased from Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000 per month standard gross salary.<br>
		o Medical Grant may be applied up to a maximum of Rs.25,000/- in a 
		twelve month period<br>
		o A General Purpose Loan has been introduced to meet other emergency 
		financial requirements. <br>
		<br>
		• IBA will now contribute each year an amount maximum up to 0.4% of the 
		total IBA students’ revenue (instead of 0.2% in current policy).<br>
		<br>
		• It is estimated that an additional financial impact of Rs.500,000 will 
		be incurred annually against the above mentioned changes which will be 
		overcome from the interest earned on the fund.<br>
		<br>
		2.2 The Dean &amp; Director emphasized that IBA employees’ children getting 
		admission in our program should be properly publicized so that the 
		children of other employees of IBA are encouraged and motivated. He 
		further said that policy related to Qarz-e-Hasna should also be 
		publicized. <br>
		<br>
		2.3 On the proposal of increasing the contribution from 0.2 percent to 
		0.4 percent of the revenue, the Dean &amp; Director said that as the total 
		revenue as well as the enrolment of students is increasing, the amount 
		of 0.2 percent contribution would be much larger than past years. There 
		is no need to increase the percentage of contribution. He suggested to 
		reinvest the interest earned on the contributed amount. <br>
		<br>
		2.4 Mr. Imran Batada asked if there can be any collaboration of IBA with 
		good schools whereby children of IBA employees can also study in those 
		schools such as Beacon House, City School and IBA can pay their fee. The 
		Dean &amp; Director appreciated the idea and said that he would look into it 
		and talk to Beacon House, City School, and Generation School. He said 
		that The Educators can also be considered. He said that we may expand 
		the scope of our policy and add that if anybody gets admission in Beacon 
		House, City School, or Generation School IBA will reimburse their fee as 
		we do for higher education. Mr. Moeid Sultan said that in the category 
		of school going children, the number is much higher for which the fund 
		is not available. The Director Projects suggested that Zakat may also be 
		given to this fund. The Dean &amp; Director agreed with the Director 
		Projects and said that people can be persuaded for giving Zakat to this 
		fund. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		2.5 The Committee approved the proposed changes in Staff Welfare Fund 
		Policy as presented by Mr. Moeid Sultan except the proposal of raising 
		the contribution from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent. <br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		2.6 Mr. Adnan Hameed would find out the age group of the low paid 
		employees (around 150 in number), where their wards are studying, and 
		what would be the financial implications if provided schooling at the 
		proposed schools and present it to the EC for consideration.<br>
		<br>
		2.7 The Director Finance would report the proposed changes in Staff 
		Welfare Fund Policy to the A&amp;FC for approval. <br>
		<br>
		<br>

		</b><br>
		<b>a) <u>Up-dates from Director Projects.</u> </b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Beautification of the old mosque:</b><br>

		him to get the design of data centre of the Main Campus prepared free of 
		cost which they have done and have handed over to the ICT Department.

		<br>
		<b>Use of in-house capacity instead of hiring Project Management firms.<br>
		</b><br>
		3.4 The Director Projects stated that most of the projects at IBA were 
		done through Project Management firms. However, he said that over the 
		period of five years they have gone through various difficulties in 
		settling disputes among the Project Manager, Contractor, and the 
		Consultants. He said that since the in-house team has become mature 
		enough, his request was that for Blocks B and C of the Boys’ Hostel the 
		in-house team can be used instead of Project Manager. <br>
		<br>
		The Dean &amp; Director said that it is premature as they have not yet been 
		informed as to how much fund has been approved by the Chief Minister. He 
		advised the Director Projects that once the approval in writing is 
		received then he (Director Projects) may develop implementation plan in 
		that he can give his argument for deploying Projects staff instead of 
		Project Manager. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of 
		thanks to the Chair.<br>
