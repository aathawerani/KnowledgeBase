      He reported that subsequently detailed planning, designing and costing

  at:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraph><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;

  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.3     The
  Director Projects said that this was discussed with Mr. M. Jawad Khan,
  Electrical Engineer and, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed, Maintenance Manager of IBA. He
  presented a line diagram of both the systems. He said that complete BOQ were
  prepared for the combined option ’B’ and option ‘A’, which were arrived at after
  the detailed scrutiny of contractor’s offer and the existing BOQ of awarded
  contract to M/s. National Engineering Co.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.4     The
  combined cost of option ‘B’ and ‘A’ comes to Rs.13,846,524/- out of which the
  cost of Rs.5,954,063/- is chargeable to existing BOQ of the  main Contract
  given to M/s. National Engineering Co. He said that after both the options
  are exercised, the additional cost would be Rs.7,892,461/-</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.5 
     He said that the cost of Rs.5,435,475/- will be a complete extra item. However,
  ATS cost of Rs.1.67 million will be for permanent installation and is
  essentially required to be there when Plan A is executed. He said that a BoQ
  item for ATS amounting to Rs.0.8 million existed in Aman CED original
  contract but this one would be a bigger one. The 95 mm cables (1416 feet),
  costing Rs.2.9 million can be re-used in future. He said that the Contractor
  can complete the work on Plan B by 31<sup>st</sup> August, 2012, if the
  approval is given on 13<sup>th</sup> August.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.6 
     He said that in case only option ‘A’ is to be executed then its cost would
  be Rs.10.946 million (Cost of Options B&amp;A = Rs.13,846,524/- minus the cost
  of 95 mm cable Rs.2,889,855/- = Rs.10.946 million.  He said that when item
  chargeable to BOQ (Rs.5,954,063/-) is deducted from Rs.10.946 million, the 
  additional amount required to implement option ‘A’ would be Rs.4.992 million
  which can further be reduced to Rs.4.2 million by deducting Rs.0.8 million
  provided for the ATS in the original contract. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.7
      The Director Projects informed the Committee that the contractor has
  committed that he would implement option ‘A’ by 20<sup>th</sup> September, if
  the approval is given to him on 13<sup>th</sup> August 2012. The Contractor has
  also required that the KESC power at VCB should be available on 15<sup>th</sup>
  September to complete the connections.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.8     The
  Director Projects informed the Committee that the cost of running generator
  for 10 hours per day is Rs.112,310/- Thus for 20 days it would cost Rs.2,246,200/-
  He said that in implementation of both options ‘B’ &amp; ‘A’, the approval for
  an extra cost of Rs.7.892 million would be required.  In implementing option
  ‘A’ only, Rs.4.992 million additional cost would be required that would mean
  that we can achieve only a saving of Rs.2.9 million in foregoing option ‘B’,
  under which only 100KW shall be available on 1st September 2012. In this case
  the generator will have to be operated from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2012 to 20<sup>th</sup>
  September, the cost of which will come to Rs.2.246 million. He said that if
  we wait for execution of the infrastructure works then they would have to run
  the generator for 5 to 6 months; the expenses of which would be around Rs.15
  million plus cost of wear and tear and above all there would be no back up
  available. </span></p>

  on the above, the Director Projects recommended that the approval for implementation
  of both the options be given which has also been recommended by the
  Consultants. </span></p>

  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>1.10    The

  Dean &amp; Director wanted to know if, when the KESC supply is available, the
  1416 feet 95 mm cable which is estimated to cost Rs.2.9 million can be used or
  sold if not needed.  The Director Projects replied that the cable can either
  be used in our own project or it can be sold if not needed.<span

  Dean &amp; Director said that the ICT equipments are to be energized for
  which it has been suggested by the Consultant that 100 KW will be enough for
  the building except the chiller. He said that for the time being (till the
  KESC supply is available) there would be no AC in the offices and faculty and
  staff would be requested to bear this for some time i.e. till October 2012.
  He said that our priority is IT server and ICT equipments which should be
  energized.  He asked Mr. Khalid Pervez if we can do the work with 100 KW. </span></p>

  Registrar said that he has 60 pedestal fans in his stock which can be
  provided to the offices.  Mr. Khalid Pervez confirmed that 60 pedestal fans,
  36 lap tops, 25 desk tops and 04 split ACs (in the server room) would require
  60 KW and still there would 40 KW available for miscellaneous requirements.
  The Director ICT said that 30 KW alone would be required for the Server and
  UPS.  He suggested that to manage the load they may switch off the servers
  after 5:00 p.m.  However, the Registrar said that he has alternate
  arrangement and he would take care of the uninterrupted power requirement of
  the servers and UPS for 24 hours.  He suggested that Option ‘A’ only be
  approved as there is huge difference of cost between the two options. Mr.
  Khalid Pervez also agreed with the Registrar.</span></p>

  Director Projects said that on Aman CED the contractor on the electrical
  works is the same and as such a separate variation order can be issued for
  the ATS against Aman CED contract. The value of the variation order would be
  determined after deducting the amount of the two breakers to be furnished by
  the Maintenance Manager and adding an approximate cost of Rs.200,000/- being
  the amount needed for making ATS 100% automatic.  He said that the value of
  the ATS cost as recommended by the Consultant is Rs.1,657,416/- Thus the
  value of variation order for the electrical infrastructure shall be (Rs.4.992
  – Rs.1.657) = Rs.3.335 million and the total value of both the variation
  order should not exceed Rs.4.2 million.</span></p>

  Committee approved Option ‘A’ which would cost around Rs.4.2 million as
  compared to Option ‘B’ which would not serve the purpose effectively as the
  Servers and UPS will have to be shut down at night. Option ‘A’ would require
  the generator to be operational from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2012 to 20<sup>th</sup>
  September, 2012 for 8 working hours per day.  The decision was based on (a)
  cost effectiveness, (b) Classes can be held on time in September 2012, (c)

  Campus where Mr. Habib-ur-Rahman and Ms. Mahwish Butt are seated can be
  provided to the IRC team and Mr. Habib and Ms. Mahwish may be placed
  somewhere else. He requested the Registrar to find out some alternate place
  for Mr. Habib and Ms. Mahwish.  Mr. Zafar Siddiqui suggested that the IRC, CDC
  and CED teams should sit together.     </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>2.10    About

  the students from Sudan, and Ethiopia studying at Karachi University. He
  suggested to invite Karachi University, NED, and Dow University.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>2.12    About
  the IRC Documentation and Budgets, the Director H.R. said that the budget for
  IRC would be accommodated in the already approved budget for Communication so
  there is no need to prepare a separate budget for IRC.  She said that the
  total estimated cost for the printed material, video and social media would
  be around Rs.250,000 to Rs.300,000/- </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>2.13    The
