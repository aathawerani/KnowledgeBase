		<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="en-gb">
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 1 Strategy Implementation Report – (January to December 
		2013).<br>
		</b><br>
		1.1 The Dean &amp; Director said that he has made some corrections in the 
		draft strategy report. He asked Mr. Adnan Hameed to send the corrected 
		draft to all concerned requesting them to send their comments by January 
		15, 2014. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.2 Mr. Adnan Hameed would send the corrected draft report on Strategy 
		Implementation to all concerned and obtain their feedback by January 15, 
		2014. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.2 To consider and approve the installation of Glass Vestibule 
		on Entrance of Aman CED Building, Main Campus. <br>
		</b><br>
		2.1 The Director Projects reported that mould growth on corridor walls, 
		ground and 1st floor was observed in Aman-CED Building. He said that to 
		investigate the reasons a joint visit was held with Architect Mr. Zayd 
		Bilgrami of NBCL and Mr. Farooq Mehboob of M/s.SMC on August 26, 2013. 
		Architect submitted their report on August 27, 2013 by email. According 
		to the report, the Mould Growth is due to the fact that doors and 
		windows are being left open specially frequent use of main entrance 
		glass door allowing hot humid air to enter, mix with the cool air and 
		create condensation. In the darker areas of the building it is creating 
		mould growth. <br>
		<br>
		2.2 The Director Projects informed the Committee that the Architect has 
		suggested that Air Curtain on front door should be operative all the 
		time. Furthermore, they have proposed that double door (Vestibule) or 
		revolving door on main entrance may be provided to prevent hot/humid air 
		in the building to avoid mould growth in future and frequent breakdown 
		of the glass door. He said that revolving door would be very costly – 
		around Rs.6 million. He said that the Architect has submitted drawing 
		and Engineer’s estimate of glass vestibule. The drawing and Engineer’s 
		estimate were presented to the EC. He said that the estimated cost of 
		work is Rs.444,550/- He requested the Executive Committee to approve 
		estimated cost of the work in order to proceed work as per procurement 
		procedure. <br>
		<br>
		2.3 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know about the aesthetical look of the 
		proposed vestibule. The Director Projects said that the Architect has 
		designed it and have confirmed that aesthetically it would be O.K. The 
		Director Projects further said that the proposed vestibule would stop 
		dust and moisture and at the same time will help in maintaining the 
		air-conditioning cooling which would result in reduction in cooling 
		expenses. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		2.4 The Committee approved the installation of Glass Vestibule on 
		Entrance of Aman CED Building, Main Campus as proposed by the Director 
		Projects. The Committee also approved the engineers estimate of 
		Rs.444,550/-.<br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		2.5 The Director Projects would float tender for the above mentioned 
		work. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.3 Demonstration of Smart Board.</b> <br>
		<br>
		3.1 Mr. Imran Batada said that as it was discussed in the last EC 
		meeting that we should have smart board in our classes, he has arranged 
		a demonstration of Smart Board that is integrated with our Epson 
		Multimedia. He said that this technology is very common in Pakistan. 
		Now, not only universities, but also schools are using smart board 
		technology. He said that he would like to have a pilot for the upcoming 
		semester therefore, would like to procure small quantity as per EC 
		decision for the Spring 2014 Semester. He further said that the smart 
		board technology is not that costly since we would be using the same 
		brand as the multimedia brand, we can make arrangement from our existing 
		budget. He sought approval for Smart Board Epson from ABM Data Systems 
		(the sole distributor of EPSON).<br>
		<br>
		3.2 A demonstration of Smart Board was given by the representative of 
		ABM Data Systems. It was observed that the hand writing appeared as it 
		was written; it could not be digitalized. For digitalization OCR 
		software would be required. Mr. Imran Batada said that he would figure 
		it out. Mr. Batada said that Smart Board KIT would cost around Rs.90,000 
		to Rs.95,000 and if multimedia is also included that it would cost 
		around Rs.275,000/- Dr. Sayeed Ghani suggested that a demonstration of 
		the Smart Board to faculty be given and their feedback should be 
		obtained before purchasing the KIT. <br>
		<br>
		3.3 Mr. Batada suggested to procure one smart board for each campus's 
		pilot run in order to get feedback from faculty members.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION&amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		3.4 Mr. Imran Batada would arrange a demonstration of Smart Board with 
		the text conversion facility.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 4 To consider and approve second special secured advance to 
		M/s. Project Managers, the Contractors for renovation of existing 
		Library at the Main Campus.</b><br>
		<br>
		4.1 The Director Projects said that the progress of work at the existing 
		library at IBA Main Campus had been slow because of the deficiency of 
		the Contractor M/s. Project Managers. He said that liquidated damages 
		had already been imposed on the contractor, even after which his 
		progress did not improve. The contractor did not renew the Performance 
		Guarantee as well. The Director Projects informed the Committee that 
		this matter was discussed with the Dean &amp; Director, Projects Department, 
		M/s. NESPAK and the Finance Department to find out a solution so that 
		the matter would not go into litigation. The Dean &amp; Director advised 
		them to find out a solution so the work is completed as early as 
		possible without going into legal action. The Director Projects reported 
		that a special meeting in this regard was held on 1st January 2014, in 
		NESPAK’s office, which was attended by Mr. Farhat Adil, Vice President 
		NESPAK &amp; his full team, Engr. Rehan A. Riaz, Director Projects IBA &amp; his 
		team and Mr. Said Hussain, Director M/s. Project Managers and his team. 
		After detailed discussion and deliberation, the following course of 
		action was agreed by all present:<br>
		<br>
		a) The Contractor should be facilitated by releasing his bills as early 
		as possible in a manner that the previous special advance given to him 
		is fully adjusted.<br>
		<br>
		b) Insurance companies be informed that the contractor is continuing the 
		work and for that period plus one year period defect liability be 
		provided by the insurance companies (Engr. Abdul Rehman, Sr. Manager 
		Projects spoke with the Management of Adamjee Insurance who accepted to 
		issue the performance guarantee). Contractor was informed and is in 
		touch with the Adamjee Insurance.<br>
		<br>
		c) In order to ease the financial problems of the contractor a second 
		special secured advance of Rs.5.00 (Rupees five million only) be 
		provided to the contractor as his previous advance stands fully 
		adjusted. In this regard M/s. NESPAK have given their recommendations.
		<br>
		<br>
		4.2 The Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to approve 
		issuance of special advance of Rs.5 million subject to the condition 
		that the contractor would revalidate his previous guarantee with the 
		amendment. He said that if approved by the EC, necessary Amendment will 
		be issued by the IBA. He informed that the contractor has undertaken 
		that he would complete the work by the 30th March 2014.<br>
		<br>
		4.3 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to what was the total awarded 
		cost of the project and how much has so far been spent. Mr. Jehanzeb 
		when contacted on phone informed that the awarded cost of the project 
		was Rs.127.6 million out of which payment of Rs.74.8 million including 
		advance has been made. Mr. Abdul Rahman was asked as to bill for how 
		much amount against the work done by the contractor has been submitted. 
		Mr. Abdul Rahman said that a bill of Rs.12 million has been submitted by 
		the Contractor out of which Rs.6 million would be adjusted to advances. 
		He said that carpet of Rs.3 million has been delivered against which 
		they have asked for a reimbursement of 70%. Similarly, he said that 
		lighting also costs Rs.3 to Rs.4 million. The Dean &amp; Director said that 
		he wanted zero risk for IBA in making this advance. The Director 
		Projects said that the second secured advance of Rs.5 million is risk 
		free because Rs.5 million is already available as the Retention Money 
		and a performance bond is also being taken. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		4.4 The Committee approved the second secured advance of Rs.5 million to 
		M/s. Project Managers, the Contractors for renovation and refurbishment 
		of existing Library at the Main Campus.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 5 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.<br>
		<br>
		a) Approval for construction of boundary wall and ramp road on the 
		southern side of the under-construction Auditorium at City Campus.</b><br>
		<br>
		5.1 The Director Projects reported that the construction of the boundary 
		wall and ramp road at City Campus has been delayed due to the reason 
		that the owner of adjacent plot did not agree that his wall should be 
		demolished and replaced by new wall of IBA. He said that MJS Foundation 
		is pressing for quite sometimes that the boundary wall was hindering 
		their work and progress. In this regard he said that they asked the 
		contractor M/s. Al-Shafi Enterprise who is working on the Auditorium, to 
		engage the Structural Engineer to design the wall and the ramp road. The 
		design has been completed on the basis of which this wall will be 
		constructed in the property line of IBA and without demolishing boundary 
		wall of neighbouring plot. He said that the boundary wall and ramp road 
		would be part of the external development work at City Campus. He 
		presented the drawing which was already checked by the Projects 
		Department and found correct.<br>
		<br>
		5.2 The Director Projects informed the Committee that M/s. Al-Shafi 
		Enterprise have accepted the responsibility for complete designing and 
		supervision. He presented their Technical &amp; Financial proposals. The 
		total cost of the work is Rs.3,058,245/-. M/s. Al-Shafi Enterprise is 
		ready to do the job at Rs.3.00 million. The Director Projects said that 
		the cost is reasonable and the item-wise BoQ has been checked by Sr. 
		Manager Project of IBA City Campus.<br>
		<br>
		5.3 The Director Projects requested the EC that the work of construction 
		of boundary wall and the ramp may be approved and be awarded to M/s. Al-Shafi 
		Enterprise at a lump sum cost of Rs.3.00 million whcih includes the 
		supervision charges of their Consultant as well. He said that it will be 
		time consuming to go for tendering process and will further impact the 
		construction of auditorium. Secondly it is very economical if the job is 
		done by the same Contractor who is already working there. Thirdly, it 
		will be very difficult to get a third contractor at Aman Tower site 
		because of the non availability of space for material storage and 
		construction work very close to the existing building.<br>
		<br>
		5.4 As there is no provision of Rs.3 million in the budget for this 
		work, the Director Projects suggested that this work may be charged to 
		Aman Tower. However, the Dean &amp; Director suggested to charge it to 
		Auditorium as Al-Shafi is working for the auditorium. He said that it 
		would be a temporary arrangement for accounting purpose and when the 
		budget is approved for this, the amount would be reimbursed by IBA.<br>
		<br>
		5.5 The Director Projects said that the Architect of Aman Tower wants 
		solid wall while that of MSJ wants Jangla around the buildings. The Dean 
		&amp; Director said that all should be Jangla so that the buildings are 
		visible from outside. He further said that the Jangla should be such 
		that people cannot trespass it. However, he asked the Director Projects 
		that before taking a final decision he should consult with the Security 
		Incharge if jangla is advisable from security point of view. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		5.6 The Committee approved the construction of boundary wall and ramp 
		road on the southern side of the under-construction Auditorium at City 
		Campus through Al-Shafi Enterprises at a lump sum cost of Rs.3 million.<br>
		<br>
		5.7 The Committee decided that subject to security clearance, there 
		would be Jangla of appropriate height around the Aman Tower and MJS 
		Auditorium.<br>
		<br>
		<b>b) Solution to broken/damaged sewerage lines at IBA Staff Town.</b><br>
		<br>
		5.8 The Director Projects reported that as decided by EC, he consulted 
		with Mr. Abdul Mateen of NESPAK on the issue of sewerage line at IBA 
		Staff Town. He said that the immediate solution is to put 550’ line and 
		the line of a bungalow be annexed to it because the sewerage line of 
		other bungalows is not upto the required level. The line would be 
		connected to HEJ Line. He said that he reviewed the design which was 
		prepared by NESPAK in 2009 but because of its cost it was not executed. 
		Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that they had assumed that when the sewerage line 
		of Karachi University would be ready, they would get the IBA Staff Town 
		sewerage line connected to it but Karachi University does not have the 
		resources to complete it. The Dean &amp; Director said that we should not go 
		for the Karachi University sewerage line as they may not meet our future 
		needs. The Director Projects said that the total cost for the sewerage 
		line from Gate to Old Girls’ Hostel as suggested by M/s Al-Shafi 
		Enterprises is Rs.2,194,499/- for which he would find budget from Admin. 
		Building. Mr. Moeid Sultan wanted to know if we are following the 
		procurement rule. The Director Projects said that if we charge Admin 
		Building, it would be within 15% of the project cost and would be 
		carried out by Al-Shafi Enterprises. The Dean &amp; Director asked as to who 
		is doing the external development work at Main Campus. The Director 
		Projects replied that M/s. Venture Crest are working on the External 
		Development project. The Dean &amp; Director suggested that the proper 
		course of action would be that the sewerage work of IBA Staff Town is a 
		component of the External Development. The winner of the contract for 
		External Development M/s. Venture Crest may be issued variation order 
		for carrying out this work. Venture Crest may choose to sub-contract it 
		to Al-Shafi as they are already mobilized there and Venture Crest does 
		not have the resources. The Director Projects said that he would follow 
		this process. <br>
		<br>
		5.9 The Director Projects suggested to get the sewerage design of Staff 
		Town prepared by NESPAK back in 2009 reviewed by them keeping in mind 
		the future requirements including faculty apartments and included in the 
		Master Plan for future use. He said that if approved by EC, he would 
		prepare and advertise the RFP. <br>
		<br>
		DECSION &amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		5.10 The Committee approved the award of External Sewerage system of IBA 
		Staff Town to Venture Crest who may sub-contract the work to M/s. Al-Shafi 
		Enterprises at a cost of Rs.2.194 million.<br>
		<br>
		5.11 The Director Projects would prepare and advertise the RFP for the 
		sewerage of Staff Town. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 6 Reporting Items:<br>
		<br>
		a) Up-date on Unit System:</b><br>
		<br>
		6.1 Mr. Imran Batada reported that he was working on unit system and 
		during this month he would make a presentation to the EC. He said that 
		he has taken last two years publication data (from Fall 2010) and got 
		entered into ERP. He said that from next week they would make it live. 
		Faculty members would enter their publication and CBER would verify and 
		approve it. However, he said that for verification no human resource is 
		available at CBER. The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Batada to request Ms. 
		Huma Sameer Amir to verify and approve the publication of faculty 
		because she is drawing research fellow allowance. <br>
		<br>
		<b>b) Computer Lab at old data centre:</b><br>
		<br>
		6.2 Mr. Imran Batada reported that old data centre has been vacated. He 
		said that earlier it was planned that faculty members would be moved to 
		the old data centre and the faculty lounge would be converted into a 
		computer lab. However, he said that 28 desk tops were placed at the old 
		data centre and at the faculty lounge 32 desktop can be accommodated. 
		The Dean &amp; Director suggested not to disturb the faculty lounge just to 
		create additional space for only 4 desktops.<br>
		<br>
		There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of 
		thanks to the Chair.</span></font></p>
