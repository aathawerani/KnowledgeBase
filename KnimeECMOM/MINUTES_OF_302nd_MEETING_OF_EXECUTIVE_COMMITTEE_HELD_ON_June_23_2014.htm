				<span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Zafar A. Siddiqui, and Dr. M. Shahid 
				Qureshi, Program Director CED attended the meeting on special 
				invitation. <br>
				<br>
				Before considering the agenda items of the meeting, the 
				Executive Committee offered Fateha for Dr. Matin A. Khan, 
				Professor Emeritus who expired on Sunday, June 22, 2014. The 
				Committee offered heart-felt condolences to the bereaved family.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.1 <u>Up-dated status of cost of construction of 
				Clinic and solicitation of advice for further action.</u></b><u>
				</u><br>
				<br>
				1.1 The Director Projects stated that in its meeting held on 
				13th June 2014, the matter pertaining to the award of the 
				contract for construction of Clinic to the lowest bidder at a 
				cost of Rs.18,739,734/- was duly approved by the Procurement 
				Committee as well as the Executive Committee. However, the Audit 
				and Finance Committee in its meeting held on June 12, 2014 
				observed that the cost of construction is too high and advised 
				the Director Projects to get the design further reviewed by the 
				architects to bring down the cost of construction. He reported 
				that the following is the status of the value engineering 
				already done even after the bidding, for which revised bid 
				process was completed. <br>
				<br>
				Original Engineer’s Estimate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Rs.25,838,135<br>
				<br>
				Original Lowest Bid (M/s. Badar Engineering Works)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Rs.24,413,027<br>
				(Bid opened on April 19, 2014)<br>
				<br>
				Engineer’s Estimate after Value Engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Rs.18,284,061<br>
				<br>
				Lowest Bid (M/s. Hascon Engineering Services)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Rs.18,739,734<br>
				(Revised Bid opened on May 24, 2014)<br>
				<br>
				1.2 The Director Projects said that the Architects M/s NBCL were 
				advised to review design and further reduce the cost. However, 
				according to their advice they can only reduce the cost by 
				Rs.0.8 million to Rs.0.9 million by revising the structure for a 
				single story building instead of Ground +1. Also the building 
				being at an important location it may not be feasible to 
				compromise on its façade elements which will disturb the overall 
				ambiance. He reported that on June 21 he talked to Mr. Zayed 
				Bilgrami and convinced him to change the design so that it 
				should be made simple. He said that NBCL will charge for the 
				redesigning. He requested the Executive Committee to consider 
				all these aspects and advise further course of action.<br>
				<br>
				1.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that for a small clinic we would 
				not require Architect, he advised the Director Projects to get 
				it designed by Ms. Sana Tanveer. However, the Director Projects 
				reported that Ms. Sana Tanveer is not available after June 30, 
				2014. The Dean &amp; Director suggested to reduce the size of the 
				hall and the number of beds from 4 to two and accordingly give a 
				new tender document to those pre-qualified bidders who had 
				participated earlier. <br>
				<br>
				1.4 The Registrar suggested that on the first floor of the 
				existing cafeteria of staff there is a huge place on which 
				doctor can sit. However, the Director Projects said that 
				patients will have difficulty in getting to the first floor. The 
				Registrar said that one large open space on the ground floor and 
				one large open space on the first floor with one toilet should 
				be enough. The Director Projects said that the lay out will be 
				changed and for redesigning they have to pay some fee to NBCL. 
				The Dean &amp; Director said that NBCL have done so many projects of 
				IBA. For this small work they should not demand any fee. The 
				Director Projects said that he would talk to Mr. Zayd and would 
				try to get the project completed within Rs.15 million (the 
				amount committed by the donor). <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Director Projects in consultation with the Registrar 
				would modify the tender documents so that the project is 
				completed within Rs.15 million.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 <u>To consider and approve IBA-CED and Deutsche 
				Bank Greenhouse Initiative – Land Requirement.</u></b> <br>
				<br>
				2.1 Dr. Shahid Qureshi stated that as part of IBA CED’s 
				Entrepreneurship Initiative two students Yousuf Motiwala (04278) 
				and Ibrahim Petiwala (04247) of BBA- Entrepreneurship of the 6th 
				Semester are working on a green house project using hydroponic 
				method of farming. Hydroponics is a modern farming method where 
				plants are grown without soil. This method has many benefits as 
				compared to traditional means as both product quality and 
				quantity are far better as compared to that from the traditional 
				method; as well as need for a fertile land is eliminated so 
				practically this method can be carried out on any piece of land. 
				This method is already very popular in the developed counties 
				specifically Australia and USA.<br>
				<br>
				2.2 Dr. Shahid Qureshi reported that the students intend to 
				start by growing tomatoes and chillies in the greenhouse and for 
				this they have through IBA-CED already collaborated with the 
				Deutsche Bank-Pakistan. This project has far-reaching benefits 
				not just in terms of providing an entrepreneurship opportunity 
				to the students of IBA but also the learning achieved through 
				this project can be disseminated to the society at large as 
				well, for the benefit for all. This is something that Deutsche 
				Bank is also interested in. The students plan to start on 8000 
				square yards piece of land at North Nazimabad for which EC’s 
				approval is requested.<br>
				<br>
				2.3 The Registrar said that the concerned plot is about 8459 sq 
				yds in size, it has a grilled perimeter and was acquired by IBA 
				in late 90’s for purpose of developing a skill development 
				center/classes. Presently, it is lying unused and has two IBA 
				guards performing duty on 24 hour basis. He said that initially 
				the students had asked for a place in the staff town but they 
				were told that that was not possible (because of the past 
				experience) and were offered to work at the plot in Boys’ 
				Hostel. He said that behind the existing block they can provide 
				400 yards but the problem is that there is a mountain of soakage 
				pit earth which cannot be used and has to be removed. 
				Alternatively he had suggested the Nazimabad Plot which was 
				given for skill development centre. The Dean &amp; Director said 
				that projects such as hydroponics are also a part of skill 
				development. He said that there are many ways of 
				entrepreneurship and skill development for Entrepreneurship 
				courses. It is not confined to classroom teaching only. He said 
				that we can have a classroom or couple of classrooms and start 
				outreach programs for the intermediate students of government 
				colleges of surrounding areas such as New Karachi, North 
				Karachi, F.B Area, Nazimabad etc. He said that IBA can also 
				start summer program for the catchment areas – students of 
				Government schools, and colleges can be provided training there.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.4 Dr. Shahid Qureshi said that the duration of the project of 
				the students is of one year. He said that from next summer they 
				can provide orientation course for students of those areas. Mr. 
				Jahanzeb said that the plot is covered with bushes which have to 
				be cleaned. The Registrar said that they would provide the 
				space; cleaning and other related work will be the 
				responsibility of the project sponsor. He said that a proper 
				agreement will have to be signed with the sponsor. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Committee approved the proposal of greenhouse project to 
				be started at North Nazimabad Plot of IBA. <br>
				<br>
				2.6 Dr. Shahid Qureshi, the Registrar and the Director Projects 
				would sort out the details and requirements for classroom, 
				toilet, furniture etc. for summer orientation to be started next 
				year.<br>
				<br>
				2.7 Mr. Zafar A. Siddiqui was requested to find a donor for the 
				classroom, toilets and other related facilities. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.3 <u>Up-date on ELP Projects.</u></b><br>
				<br>
				3.1 Mr. Zafar Siddiqui provided up-date on the ELP Projects. He 
				said that there are 375 students which would require 75 projects 
				and 15 advisors- one advisor would handle 5 projects. He said 
				that he has received names of 13 advisors. However, he said that 
				he was concerned about the quality and number of advisors. He 
				said that the role of advisors starts once the students 
				registration starts in September but he would recommend that the 
				advisors should start working from August and start talking to 
				the companies about the project. He said that some teachers want 
				to be compensated. He said that the good thing is that 
				organizations have taken it positively as it would help them 
				identify management trainee for next year.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Dean &amp; Director said that he would meet the faculty 
				advisors. He did not agree that the teachers should be 
				compensated for providing advisory services as they will get a 
				waiver of one course teaching load. He suggested that visiting 
				faculty should also be approached to accept to be advisors for 
				the project. He said that he would address the advisors as soon 
				as 75 projects and their advisors are finalized. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Committee noted the up-date on the ELP Projects as given 
				by Mr. Zafar A. Siddiqui.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.4 <u>To consider and approve the revised concept 
				design of transport facilities building. </u></b><br>
				<br>
				4.1 The Director Projects presented the revised concept design 
				of transport facilities building on the basis of the suggestions 
				given by the Registrar. He said that it has been made simple and 
				its cost of construction has also been reduced. He said that two 
				stores for new and old items and an office for transport manager 
				have been provided. He said that the per square foot cost is 
				Rs.2800/- <br>
				<br>
				4.2 The Registrar said that the cost of Rs.2800/- per sft is 
				still too expensive for a transport shed. He said that he was 
				ready to forego flooring etc. The Dean &amp; Director asked the 
				Director Projects to reduce the total area as well as the per 
				sft cost so that the transport facilities building is completed 
				within Rs.5 million. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				4.3 The Director Projects would reduce the area as well as the 
				per sft cost so that the project is completed within Rs.5 
				million. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.5 <u>Additional requirements – Badminton court at 
				City Campus.</u></b><br>
				<br>
				5.1 The Director Projects reported that in accordance with the 
				EC decision to see the possibility of converting portion of the 
				existing cafeteria at City Campus into a badminton court by 
				raising the roof of the required portion, he sought advice from 
				Mr. Noshad of M/s. Icon. Mr. Noshad reviewed the drawing of 
				existing facility and compared it with the requirement of a 
				badminton court. His recommendation is as follows:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Size of court: </b><br>
				As per standard court size which is usually 20’-0”X 44’-0” and a 
				minimum 5’-0” clearance on all side is required. Which makes it 
				30’-0” X 54’-0” whereas the required clear height must be min 
				15’-0” is required.<br>
				<br>
				Here in the existing canteen the space is 24’-0” X 46’-0” and 
				height varies from 10’-0” to 14’-0”. Therefore it is impossible 
				to convert this space into badminton court by only raising the 
				height of the building as the area is less to the usual size.<br>
				<br>
				5.2 Mr. Noshad has suggested that this space should be used for 
				other indoor games like board games, table tennis, snooker, 
				fitness club etc.<br>
				<br>
				5.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that there are many other indoor 
				sports facilities available at the Campus. Dr. Shakeel Khoja 
				suggested to put some fitness / body building equipment such as 
				weight lifting, bench press etc.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				5.4 The Committee noted the advice received from Mr. Noshad of 
				Icon and decided that the portion of the existing canteen at 
				City Campus would be equipped with some fitness / body building 
				equipment.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.6 <u>To consider and approve the time extension for 
				supply and installation of passenger elevators for 
				Administration Building at Main Campus and FCS Building at City 
				Campus.</u></b><br>
				<br>
				6.1 The Director Projects reported that the contract for Supply 
				and Installation of Passenger Elevators for Admin Building Main 
				Campus and FCS Building City Campus was awarded to M/s. Reliance 
				Engineering Services at a cost of Rs.7,070,000/- The project was 
				awarded on January 27, 2014 and it was to be completed on May 
				31, 2014 i.e. in 120 days. However, due to the following reasons 
				the project could not be completed on time and an approval for 
				extension of 60 days i.e. upto July 31, 2014 is requested: <br>
				<br>
				o Chinese New Year holidays for the month of February.<br>
				o Delay in pre-shipment inspection due to visa processing from 
				embassy.<br>
				o Non availability of elevator shaft for layout works<br>
				<br>
				6.2 The Director Projects said that based on the above facts for 
				the major reasons for delay the Projects Department recommended 
				the extension of time as stated above. He informed the Committee 
				that in its meeting held on June 21, 2014 the Procurement 
				Committee recommended the approval of extension in time up till 
				July 31, 2014. Based on the recommendations of Project 
				Department and Procurement Committee he requested the Executive 
				Committee to approve the extension in time up till July 31, 2014 
				for both the buildings.<br>
				<br>
				6.3 The Director Projects clarified that this extension of time 
				shall be without reimbursement of the costs of extended 
				preliminaries, cost of operations, additional overheads or any 
				other cost whatsoever in this respect. The Contractor shall 
				extend all insurances and guarantees, related to the Contract, 
				accordingly. He further said that these Projects are done in 
				house and there is no cost involvement of Architects/Consultants 
				and Project Manager’s fees. To a question he said that the 
				elevators have been received at IBA.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				6.4 The Committee approved the time extension till July 31, 2014 
				for supply and installation of passenger elevators for 
				Administration Building at Main Campus and FCS Building at City 
				Campus.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair.</span></font></p>
