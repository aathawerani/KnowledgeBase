 DECISION1.11 The Committee decided that the outstanding amount which has been worked out at Rs.24.42 million is reasonable as the tariff as well as utilization of power at IBA Main Campus had gone through many changes and much increased over the years. The Director Finance recommended that the arrear amount bill should be paid to Karachi University in instalments. The Committee also suggested that in order to ensure that no subsequent claim is received from KU for payment of electricity bills, the settlement should be made at a higher level and be duly receipted by KU.
