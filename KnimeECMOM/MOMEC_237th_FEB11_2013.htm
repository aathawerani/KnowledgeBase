				<b>Item No.3 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.</b><br>
				<br>
				a) IBA Summer School Program – 2013.<br>
				<br>
				3.1 Ms. Maheen Ghauri said that the IBA Summer School Program 
				has been conceived by drawing up the experiences of other Summer 
				Schools at Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge, UCLA, BU, LSE, Indian 
				Bangalore Summer Programs, King’s College, Kellogg, and Monash. 
				The concept is to develop and sustain a wide-range of beneficial 
				and innovative academic and recreational courses and programs 
				for a diverse population of students and adults alike that would 
				benefit them in their professional and personal development. <br>
				<br>
				3.2 Ms. Maheen Ghauri said that most summer schools offer a wide 
				variety of summer courses that can range from 1 week (short 
				term) courses to 6 weeks (long term) courses. Summer schools 
				offer more than just academic courses. For instance, 
				self-development and recreational courses such as reading, 
				creative writing, photography, sketching, music, dancing, women 
				entrepreneurship, SAT &amp; GRE preparation may be offered. She said 
				that in Pakistan, the Summer School concept is still novel in 
				the Higher Education segment. LUMS has launched summer camps, 
				but there are still no summer schools developed or launched 
				based on the pattern of the above-mentioned universities. <br>
				<br>
				3.3 She said that currently, IBA has been offering business 
				courses every summer to individuals including current students, 
				undergraduates and graduates from other universities, and 
				adults. By offering academic as well as self-development and 
				recreational courses in the IBA Summer School Program, the 
				students would learn from eminent faculty and instructors who 
				are specialists in their field, through a stimulating experience 
				that would augment their academic, professional, and personal 
				lives.<br>
				<br>
				3.4 The IBA Summer School’s primary emphasis is to enable 
				individuals to develop and enrich their academic, professional, 
				and personal lives. Thus, the Summer School will design, 
				develop, and offer courses that benefit a diverse audience 
				within and outside Pakistan. The key objectives of the IBA 
				Summer School Program include:<br>
				<br>
				• To introduce, develop, and launch the IBA Summer School 
				Program by March 2013 <br>
				• To develop 1 week (short term) courses to 6 weeks (long term) 
				courses that can be offered to a diverse group of candidates<br>
				• To provide IBA faculty with teaching opportunities that allow 
				them to apply innovative teaching techniques and pedagogy within 
				the classroom<br>
				• To invite well-known and experienced visiting faculty from 
				diverse fields to conduct short courses at IBA<br>
				• To collaborate with the CEE and CED to design short courses 
				that can be taught at the summer school.<br>
				• To provide a stimulating learning environment through a range 
				of innovative academic, self-development, and recreational 
				courses taught by prominent faculty from and outside IBA.<br>
				• To promote IBA as one of the top schools in Pakistan, so as to 
				attract people from other cities and countries to join our 
				diverse degree programs<br>
				• To increase the enrolment in the IBA Summer School to at least 
				1,500 students in Year 1.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ELIGIBILTY CRITERIA</b><br>
				<br>
				3.5 Ms. Maheen Ghauri said that the following is the proposed 
				eligibility criteria:<br>
				<br>
				• Students currently enrolled in A-levels (high school) or 
				Intermediate (college) in any discipline<br>
				• Students enrolled in an institute of higher education<br>
				• Adults with a minimum qualification of Intermediate of 
				A-levels<br>
				• Current IBA undergraduate, graduate, or PhD students<br>
				<br>
				3.6 The Dean &amp; Director said that he and the Board are both 
				concerned that we must have a financial sustainability model 
				because so many buildings will be ready and the recurring 
				expenditures on maintenance would require huge amount, so 
				capacity utilization will have to be maximized. He said that we 
				have endowment fund and from its income we will partially 
				finance but we have to find other sources of income from 
				non-regular programs. CEE, CED, CBER have to provide 
				supplementary revenues to augment our regular programs. He said 
				that many universities have thriving Summer Schools that bring 
				significant revenues. We should start with those courses for 
				which we have the expertise. Highlighting the benefits of this 
				program he said that the existing teachers can enhance their 
				income by teaching in this program; our capacity utilization 
				will increase, and revenue will also rise. He said that we would 
				try to use the existing courses and modify them in order to 
				cater to the demand. He said that we have to make sure that the 
				brand is not diluted in any way and there would be no compromise 
				on the contents and quality. Even in non-academic courses we 
				have to maintain certain quality and we have to build quality 
				assurance mechanism into it. After presenting the motivation and 
				concept of this program, the Dean &amp; Director sought feedback 
				from the EC members. <br>
				<br>
				3.7 To a question, the Dean &amp; Director clarified that the 
				academic courses for our regular students would continue to be 
				offered in the evening as is presently done but the non-academic 
				courses would be offered in the morning. <br>
				<br>
				3.8 Mirza Izhar Husain suggested that the Summer Program courses 
				should be announced much in advance so that students abroad may 
				know well in time. Mr. Zafar Siddiqui suggested that the target 
				market should be high school and ‘O’ level students. The Dean &amp; 
				Director said that we can inform Pakistani schools, Pakistan 
				embassies, and Pakistani associations outside Pakistan. <br>
				<br>
				3.9 Dr. Muhammad Nishat said that some students coming from 
				abroad may need credit of the courses because that credit is 
				transferred. The Dean &amp; Director said that they would see that 
				later when demand for credit is presented to us formally. At 
				this moment it will be a certificate course.<br>
				<br>
				3.10 The Dean &amp; Director suggested to offer this for both ‘O’ 
				level and ‘A’ level students, and keep it more flexible, broad 
				based. He also suggested to see the programs offered by IMS 
				Peshawar, Indus Valley School, PACC, Goethe etc. for guidance.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.11 As some members could not go through the proposal, it was 
				decided that Ms. Maheen Ghouri would present the proposal again 
				incorporating the above suggestions. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				b) 360 Feedback &amp; last EC decision’s outcome.<br>
				<br>
				3.12 Mirza Izhar Husain said that Dr. Nasir Afghan discussed the 
				case of 360 feedback with the Dean &amp; Director on February 9, 
				2013 and the Dean &amp; Director advised him to bring the matter to 
				the EC. <br>
				<br>
				3.13 The Dean &amp; Director said that he wants 360 feedback from 
				the best possible source for which he wants an open competition. 
				He said that if a faculty succeeds, he / she may do that but as 
				per rule he / she will have to pay 30% of the revenue to IBA. He 
				asked the Director Finance to check if all faculty members who 
				are offering such programs are paying 30% to IBA or not. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.14 The Committee reviewed the EC decision of February 4, 2013 
				on 360 feedback and asked Mr. Izhar Husain Mirza to place tender 
				for the 360 feedback. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				c) To consider request from Mr. Asad Salman Malik, a student of 
				BBA-II.<br>
				<br>
				3.15 Mr. Asad Salman Malik, a student of BBA-II in his email 
				stated that he took a course of Foundation of Human Behavior 
				with Dr. Erum Maqbool in the first semester. He stated that he 
				was not shown the papers or given marks of the second hourly 
				till one week after final exam. Due to this he dropped another 
				course (Calculus-I) as he was given its second hourly marks 
				within time and he realized that he was not doing well in that 
				course while thinking that his second hourly marks of Human 
				Behaviour would be satisfactory. But when he was given the 
				second hourly Human Behaviour marks a month later (after the 
				final exam), his marks were not so as he had expected. He could 
				not do anything about dropping the course or improving his grade 
				in the final either as he had already dropped Calculus-I. He 
				stated that when he was given the Human Behaviour final exam 
				result, and due to not being able to improve his grade in the 
				final (as he had not received his second hourly marks while 
				giving his final exam), he failed the course by 3.25 marks. Due 
				to this ‘F’ his first semester GPA is falling below 2.0 
				resulting in his drop out from IBA right after his first 
				semester. His contention was that if he would have been shown 
				the second hourly marks in time, he would have dropped Human 
				Behaviour instead of Calculus-I and would have passed 
				Calculus-I. He requested to allow him to drop Foundations of 
				Human Behaviour and repeat the course in the summer semester 
				instead of grading him with an ‘F’ and dropping him out of IBA.<br>
				<br>
				3.16 Dr. Muhammad Nishat said that he was told that Dr. Erum 
				Maqbool, who is a visiting faculty, was very busy so she could 
				not submit the result on time. The Dean &amp; Director asked Dr. 
				Nishat to penalize Dr. Erum Maqbool by deducting Rs.5000/- per 
				day for the period she delayed the result. <br>
				<br>
				3.17 Mr. Mobin Khalili said that many students knew their result 
				and he gave them chance to withdraw from the course and many of 
				them withdrew. He said that it is not IBA’s fault it is 
				individual’s fault. He said that withdrawal of one course is 
				allowed and that Mr. Asad Malik has already done. He said that 
				the student has already been dropped. <br>
				<br>
				3.18 The Dean &amp; Director said that the chairpersons and the 
				Associate Deans should ensure that the teacher submit the result 
				on time, failing which penalty must be imposed. We have given 
				ample opportunities to the delinquent teachers but there has 
				been no visible improvement in the posting of exam results. The 
				students suffer due to this casual and lax attitude of a few 
				among us. He said that the Examination Department had informed 
				the students about their result and the students were given the 
				opportunity to withdraw from the course. Mr. Asad Malik had 
				already withdrawn from a course so he could not withdraw from 
				another course.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.19 In view of the facts stated by the Controller of 
				Examinations as stated in 3.16 above, the Committee did not 
				accede to the request of Mr. Asad Salman Malik.<br>
				<br>
				3.20 The Committee decided that a penalty of Rs.5000/- per day 
				should be imposed on faculty member who is delinquent in posting 
				the examination results after the given deadline. <br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.21 Dr. Muhammad Nishat would convey the decision to Mr. Asad 
				Salman Malik. He would also impose penalty on Dr. Erum Maqbool 
				for late submission of the result. <br>
				<br>
				3.22 The Associate Deans would notify the faculty members about 
				the penalty for late submission of exam results. <br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair. <br>
