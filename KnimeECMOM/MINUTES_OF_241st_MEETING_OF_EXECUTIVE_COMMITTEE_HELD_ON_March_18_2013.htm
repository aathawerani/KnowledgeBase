			Acting Head of ICT<br>
			<br>
			Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects, and Ms. Sana Tanveer, 
			Assistant Architect attended the meeting on special invitation.<br>
			<br>
			The following items were discussed: <br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 1 <u>To consider and approve the continuation – 
			extension of NBCL consultancy services for Phase 2 of the new Boys’ 
			Hostel, Block B &amp; C.</u></b><br>
			<br>
			1.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed reported that following the EC's instructions 
			he and Mr. Rehanul Ambia had detailed discussion with NBCL and 
			requested them to reduce their consultancy fee from 4% to 2% for the 
			phase 2 of the new Boys’ Hostel, Block B &amp; C. He said that they told 
			NBCL that:<br>
			<br>
			(a) No major change in the structural design is involved,<br>
			(b) There is hardly any change in the MEP design,<br>
			(c) There is no HVAC design involved,<br>
			(d) Specifications need not be prepared from scratch, and<br>
			(e) No mock-ups required<br>
			<br>
			In turn, NBCL argued that:<br>
			<br>
			(a) Their own associates involved in this Consultancy assignment 
			take a fixed fee of 2% of the cost of construction,<br>
			(b) The project is not a complete repeat. There will be over a 100 
			drawings to be made which entail 2 months of man-hours of draftsmen, 
			architects and principals, <br>
			(c) Site coordination (top supervision) will continue for a period 
			of 18 months.<br>
			(d) For all of the above reasons they cannot do the project 
			financially for anything less than 3.5% of the cost of construction.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			1.2 Mr. Shameem Ahmed reported that their final meeting with NBCL 
			was held on February 28, 2013 in which, after much persuasion, NBCL 
			agreed to reduce the fee from the original 4% to 3%. He said that 
			they are of the view that 3% is a reasonable figure. He requested EC 
			to approve it.<br>
			<br>
			1.3 Mr. Shameem Ahmed brought to the knowledge of the EC the 
			following points which have resulted as a part of their discussion 
			and negotiations with NBCL’s Mr. Zayd Bilgrami.<br>
			<br>
			(a) The combined estimated covered (built up) area of Blocks B &amp; C 
			is 63,000 sq. ft. <br>
			<br>
			(b) At the rate of Rs.3,000/- per sq. ft., the total estimated cost 
			amounts to Rs.189 million.<br>
			<br>
			(c) However, it has been agreed that for the purpose of renewing our 
			Contract Agreement with NBCL for Blocks B &amp; C, the notional cost of 
			the project will be taken as Rs.120 million and payments for NBCL’s 
			services until they submit an Engineer’s Estimate will be made 
			accordingly.<br>
			<br>
			(d) On approval of the Engineer’s Estimate by IBA, the notional cost 
			will be revised and all payments made upto that stage will be 
			adjusted accordingly.<br>
			<br>
			(e) Once the project has been tendered and the awarded cost 
			determined, all payments made or to be made to NBCL will be revised 
			and adjusted as per the awarded cost. However, the final fee payable 
			to NBCL will be capped at 3% of 110% of the awarded cost in case the 
			cost of the project increases for any reason.<br>
			<br>
			(f) The project will be tendered as a whole for both Blocks B &amp; C, 
			and if the project is held up or postponed for any reason, NBCL will 
			be entitled to consultancy fee upto that stage according to the 
			approved Engineer’s Cost Estimate or the Awarded Cost, whichever is 
			less.<br>
			<br>
			1.4 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to why the total estimated 
			cost is Rs.189 million while the existing block was completed at 
			Rs.147 million. Mr. Shameem Ahmed clarified that its area is more 
			than that of the completed one, and in three years time the cost has 
			also gone up. <br>
			<br>
			1.5 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know the current occupancy status 
			of the Boys’ hostels and the projected requirements. The Registrar 
			said that as the new NTHP batch would be coming before the passed 
			out batch leaves the hostel, they have to find and arrange 
			accommodation for the NTHP students. The Registrar proposed that the 
			lab on the third floor of the new Boys’ Hostel which has a capacity 
			of 30 students can be used as dormitory for the NTHP students. <br>
			<br>
			1.6 The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Shameem Ahmed to get the height of 
			the boundary wall of the Boys’ Hostel raised on priority and then 
			start the external development work. He asked the Director Projects 
			to visit Salman Dawood School of Business of LUMS and take Mr. 
			Hasnain also along with him. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			1.7 The Committee approved the continuation – extension of NBCL 
			consultancy services for Phase 2 of the new Boys’ Hostel, Block B &amp; 
			C at 3% fee of the awarded cost.<br>
			<br>
			ACTION<br>
			<br>
			1.8 Mr. Shameem Ahmed would get the height of the boundary wall of 
			the Boys’ Hostel raised at the earliest.<br>
			<br>
			1.9 The Director Projects and Architect of Aman Tower Mr. Hasnain 
			Lotia will visit SDSB at LUMS.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 2 <u>Status Report of the sub-committee formed by the EC 
			on “Laying of Water Transmission Line at IBA Main Campus”.</u></b><br>
			<br>
			2.1 The Director Projects reported that the case of extension of 
			time and escalation in the cost of the project Laying of Water 
			Transmission Line was discussed in the 235th meeting of the 
			Executive Committee held on January 28, 2013. The Executive 
			Committee constituted a sub-committee comprising the Director 
			Projects, the Director Finance and the Chairman CPC to thoroughly 
			analyze the case and give its recommendation to the EC. He said that 
			the Sub-committee waited for the minutes of CPC which was received 
			on February 13, 2013.<br>
			<br>
			2.2 The Director Projects informed the EC that he wrote a letter on 
			11th February 2013, to the Director HEC Projects Mr. Shameem Ahmed 
			and Mr. Abdul Mateen, Advisor (Construction) M/s. NESPAK, thereby 
			raising various questions and demanded documents and correspondences 
			as those were missing in M/s. NESPAK’s presentation to the EC. He 
			reported that the Director HEC Projects submitted his replies and 
			documents on 12th March 2013. He said that he would submit the 
			report of the Sub-Committee within next 10 days. <br>
			<br>
			2.3 The Dean &amp; Director observed that the more we delay in 
			finalizing the decision about the project, the higher would be the 
			cost of completion. The Director Projects said that the cost would 
			not increase as NESPAK has recommended some overpayment which will 
			be cut down.<br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			2.4 The Committee noted the up-date. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 3 <u>To consider and approve 
			re-adjustments/re-allocation of rooms at the plans of Administration 
			Building under renovation.</u> <br>
			</b><br>
			3.1 The Director Projects reported that there was a requirement to 
			provide adequate space for the examination department on the ground 
			floor to house 6 staff members. In order to accommodate this 
			requirement, he had done certain adjustments on the ground floor and 
			the first floor. He clarified that there have been no changes in 
			layouts or any impact on the design or construction rather there 
			have been positive improvement in the re-location of various 
			departments. The greater improvement is that Registrar’s office, 
			Purchase and Administration are now on one floor. The only 
			alteration to the plan is that HOD CEE’s office is to be re located 
			to the Aman CED Building. He requested the Executive Committee to 
			approve the relocation plan. He presented below the status of the 
			original and the revised plans:<br>

			3.2 Mr. Mobin Khalili said that the area provided for the six 
			persons of the Examination Department is not sufficient. The Dean &amp; 
			Director said that the square feet area given to each executive 
			should be uniform. He asked the Director Projects and the Registrar 
			to work out the area to be provided to each executive and 
			accordingly provide the space to the six persons of Examination 
			Department. <br>
			<br>
			3.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that the CEE activity is carried out 
			mainly at the City Campus. However, if needed, we may provide space 
			to the CEE at Aman-CED Building. <br>

			<br>
			<b>Item No. 4 <u>To consider and approve the Final Evaluation Report 
			on Faculty Apartment at IBA Staff Town submitted by the 
			sub-committee formed by the EC.</u></b><br>
			<br>
			4.1 The Director Projects reported that the Executive Committee in 
			its 238th meeting held on February 18, 2013 formed a Sub-Committee 
			of three persons comprising Engr. Rehan-ul-Ambia Riaz, Mr. Javed 
			Islam of HEC Projects, and Ms. Sana Tanveer to evaluate the 
			technical proposals including the designs submitted by the 
			competitors and recommend ranking in order of 1st, 2nd and 3rd. He 
			said that in compliance the evaluation was done by the three members 
			committee and following methodology was adopted:<br>
			<br>
			&#61656; Technical capability was carried out by all the three members 
			independently based on the documentation submitted by the seven 
			competitors and established criteria already presented to the EC.<br>
			<br>
			&#61656; Total of 60 marks were assigned for the Technical Capability 
			evaluation <br>
			<br>
			&#61656; Evaluation details for assigning marks have been documented. <br>
			<br>
			&#61656; The three evaluation reports were combined and average rating was 
			obtained.<br>
			<br>
			&#61656; The evaluation of the designs were also carried out in the same 
			manner that committee carried and assigned them 40 marks. The 
			resultant marks were combined with the technical capability marks 
			resulting in the combined evaluation out of 100 total marks. <br>
			<br>
			4.2 The Director Projects said that from these criteria the 
			following competitors emerged as successful competitors in the order 
			given below:<br>
			<br>
			o M/s. NESPAK 96.3%<br>
			o M/s. FIRCO 91.6%<br>
			o M/s. CTI 90.3%<br>
			o M/s. EA Consulting 81.0%<br>
			<br>
			4.3 The Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to 
			witness the designs of the above competitors and select three of 
			them so that their financial proposals could be opened and final 
			evaluation for the successful candidate may be carried based on the 
			SPPRA criteria 80:20 (80 technical) (20 financial). The successful 
			candidate will then be awarded the job.<br>
			<br>
			4.4 The Dean &amp; Director inquired that Meinhardt is an 
			internationally reputed firm but in the evaluation it has got low 
			marks - 72.6 %. He wanted to know the reasons for low scoring. The 
			Director Projects replied that Meinhardt did not give any design and 
			they do not have on-ground capacity for project management in 
			Karachi. Mr. Moeid Sultan wanted to know if the evaluation criteria 
			were defined in the RFQ. The Director Projects confirmed that they 
			were included in the RFQ and these have also been placed on the 
			website of the SPPRA. Mr. Mobin Khalili wanted to know as to how 
			they were prequalified if they do not meet the criteria in the 
			evaluation. The Director Projects replied that for every competition 
			the technical capability for that particular project is scrutinized 
			independently depending on the nature of the work in a competitive 
			mode. He said that if they have worked with us we get to know their 
			strengths and weakness. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Design Presentations:</b><br>
			<br>
			4.5 The four consultants separately presented their designs for the 
			two and three bed room Faculty Apartments. <br>

			the Committee selected the following:<br>
			<br>
			1. M/s. FIRCO (First choice)<br>

			3. M/s. CTI (Third choice)<br>
			<br>
			ACTION<br>
			<br>
			4.7 The Director Projects would open the financial proposals of the 
			above three consultants. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No. 5 <u>To consider and approve the Extension of Time of 
			existing library.</u></b><br>
			<br>
			5.1 The Director Projects requested extension of time in the 
			completion of the renovation and refurbishment of existing library. 
			He said that the project as per contract was to be completed on 
			January 31, 2013 but due to various reasons it got delayed. He said 
			that the contractor claimed 267 days for Extension in time but after 
			detailed study by M/s NESPAK and IBA project department it was 
			recommended that 157 days are justified. He said that the case was 
			presented to the Central Purchase Committee in its meeting held on 
			16th March 2013. After due deliberations, the CPC has recommended 
			that the extension be granted to the contractor till 3rd July 2013. 
			The CPC advised the Projects Department to review the present state 
			of the progress and work out a realistic schedule as in their 
			opinion the extended period appears to be unrealistic. <br>
			<br>
			5.2 The Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to 
			consider and approve the extension up to 3rd July 2013. He informed 
			the Committee that the Project Managers have been advised to monitor 
			the work on daily basis and ensure that no further extension is 
			demanded except on extraordinary circumstances.<br>
			<br>
			5.3 The Dean &amp; Director observed that the contractor is demanding 
			267 days extension whereas the recommendation is for 157 days. He 
			said that if we allow 157 days extension, the contractor may come up 
			again for further extension. The Director Projects said that the 
			contractors have agreed to finish the project in 157 days i.e. by 
			July 3, 2013. The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know the financial 
			implications due to extension in the completion time. The Director 
			Projects said that we have to pay the project management fee for the 
			extended period. However, he said that he has not worked out the 
			amount that is to be paid. The Dean &amp; Director said that the case 
			should be presented with complete details including financial 
			implications and the commitment of the contractor to complete the 
			project by July 3, 2013.<br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			5.4 This item was deferred. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			ACTION<br>
			<br>
			5.5 The Director Projects would present the case again with complete 
			details including financial implications. He would also invite the 
			Contractor to the meeting. <br>
			<br>
			There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a vote 
			of thanks to the Chair. <br>
