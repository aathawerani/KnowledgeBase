		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin: 0 5px">
		<span lang="en-gb"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The following items 
		were discussed: <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 1 To consider and approve the extension of Project 
		Management Contract of M/s. Halcrow for existing Aman Tower Core and 
		Shell Contract; and the appointment of Halcrow for ID works package at 
		IBA Aman Tower.</b><br>
		<br>
		1.1 The Dean &amp; Director said that this item should not have been brought 
		to the EC. This should have been presented in the Committee for Aman-Tower 
		project.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.2 The Director Projects would present this item in the Committee for 
		Aman-Tower project as it does not relate to the Executive Committee.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.2 Presentation by M/s NBCL on the following aspects of 
		External Development work:</b> <br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
		Pathways in front of Library and Auditorium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
		Modification of Existing Mosque<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
		Monument Garden<br>
		<br>
		2.2 The Director Projects said that earlier it was decided to keep the 
		pathways in front of Library and Auditorium as it is and move the 
		planters ahead. He said that there is a pathway in front of the 
		auditorium, which needs to be widened due to which the existing size of 
		the lawn will be reduced. The Registrar said that he had suggested not 
		to cut the lawn. The ropes can be fixed by finding alternative space. He 
		suggested that the EC should visit the lawn in order to get a clear 
		picture. <br>
		<br>
		2.3 About the modification in the existing mosque, the Director Projects 
		said that the courtyard will have to be broken and some portion of the 
		mosque at female side will also have to be cut so that a bigger pathway 
		is available.<br>
		<br>
		2.4 About the proposed monument garden, the Dean &amp; Director said that 
		from the architectural point of view it may be good but as a user he 
		sees that the Library and Admin buildings will be hidden because of the 
		height of the free standing pillars. The Director Projects suggested to 
		develop this garden as sunk garden. Mr. Zayd said that the pillars can 
		be raised upto 8’. The Registrar observed that the proposed pillars look 
		as if there is something incomplete. Mr. Khalili said that in the last 
		EC meeting the idea of pillar was not liked. He suggested to give some 
		other ideas.<br>
		<br>
		2.5 The members after the meeting visited the site of on-going External 
		Development works to review the site conditions of the following three 
		locations:<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • 
		Pathway in front of the Library and Auditorium <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • 
		Re-modelling of the existing mosque <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • 
		Location of Monument Garden<br>
		<br>
		DECISIONS<br>
		<br>
		2.6 Based on the discussion with the Architects and site conditions, it 
		was decided that the monument garden be re-located in front of existing 
		mosque. It was further advised by the Dean &amp; Director that Architect Mr. 
		Zayd Bilgrami and the Director Projects should have a meeting to 
		finalize the details of pathways, mosque remodelling and the Monument 
		Garden which may be communicated to the Executive Committee. 
		Accordingly, the Director Projects and Engr. Mahmood Ali, held a meeting 
		with Mr. Zayd Bilgrami, the same day and took the following decisions:<br>
		<br>
		a) The limit of lawn on the north side shall be maintained at 11’- 6” 
		from the bottom of oblong columns of the Library. This will reduce the 
		size of the existing lawn by only 6 feet all along. <br>
		<br>
		b) The placement of planters shall be worked out by the Architect. The 
		Architect promised to furnish the drawings in 10 days. <br>
		<br>
		c) The Architect accepted the modification to be done to the existing 
		mosque for which he will provide the drawings in 30 days. <br>
		<br>
		d) It was agreed by the Architect that Monument Garden be shifted to the 
		front area of the existing mosque covering the area of 20’ x 20’. 
		Architect promised that the drawings will be furnished in 30 days. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 3 To consider and approve PhD degree specimen. <br>
		</b><br>
		3.1 Mr. Mobin Khalili presented the sample of the first degree that was 
		designed and printed by the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation after 
		the degree awarding status given to IBA in 1994. At that time all the 
		security features were incorporated in the degree. He said that at that 
		time the degrees were program specifics. Now he said that there is an 
		urgent requirement of PhD degree which has been designed by the 
		designing section of Security Printing Corporarion incorporating latest 
		security features. He said that the new degree will be used for all 
		programs. The Dean &amp; Director asked if there is any issue in having 
		program specific degrees. Mr. Khalili said that there is no issue but 
		program specific degree will cost too much as compared to bulk printing 
		of degrees that can be used for all programs. Dr. Mohammad Nishat asked 
		as to how much it would cost. Mr. Khalili said that if we go for 
		PhD-specific degree a minimum of 200 degrees would be printed by The 
		Security Printing Corporation and it would cost Rs.3585/- per degree; 
		for 1000 degrees it will cost Rs.769/- and for 2000 degrees it will cost 
		Rs.676/-. He further said that so far only a few have qualified for PhD 
		degree and in future too requirement of PhD degrees will be very limited 
		therefore it is not advisable to get PhD degrees printed in thousands.
		<br>
		<br>
		3.2 Mr. Khalili said that the best available features of security have 
		been included in the degree. He explained the security features made 
		available in the redesigned degree. The Registrar suggested that 
		according to our Brand Manual, there is a logo defined under which 
		“Leadership and Ideas for Tomorrow” is written, and the name of IBA is 
		written in three lines which also fit into the length of the logo. Mr. 
		Khalili said that it was not fitting into the overall symmetry, although 
		earlier it was there. The Dean &amp; Director said that if the name is split 
		in three lines then “Leadership and Ideas for Tomorrow” can also fit in 
		and it will be in symmetry. He suggested to try this way of inscription. 
		Mr. Khalili said that he would get it redesigned after splitting the 
		name of IBA in three lines, and inserting “Leadership and Ideas for 
		Tomorrow” and show it to the EC how it looks like. <br>
		<br>
		3.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that he had suggested that we should give 
		degree to the graduates at the time of convocation. Mr. Khalili said 
		that timing is the issue. The list of graduates is not finalised well 
		before the convocation because of the non-availability of results. The 
		Dean &amp; Director said that our exam is held in June and the convocation 
		is held in December. Moreover, he said that we have tightened our 
		procedure for finalization and submission of results. A fine of Rs.5000 
		will be imposed on late submission of the results. He hoped that now 
		there would be no inordinate late in submission of results. Mr. Khalili 
		said that he can manage it provided he is given a minimum 1½ months time 
		to get the degrees ready after the finalization of results. <br>
		<br>
		3.4 Mr. Khalili said that he will be getting 1000 degrees printed and 
		each degree would cost Rs.769 and the folder will cost around Rs.455/- 
		each. Thus a degree will cost around Rs.1100 to Rs.1200/- He said that 
		earlier 100% advance was given to the Security Printing Corporation but 
		since this time the amount is around Rs.900,000, the Director Finance 
		says that as per rules bank guarantee is required for advance payment. 
		The Dean &amp; Director said that Security Printing is a government 
		organization and there is no issue in making advance payment to them.
		<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		3.5 Mr. Khalili would email to the EC members the two samples of degree; 
		one as presented and another with the suggested modifications for 
		comparison and final selection. Meanwhile he was allowed to place 
		printing order to the Security Printing Corporation so that they could 
		start initial work and printing of degree is not delayed. <br>
		<br>
		There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of 
		thanks to the Chair.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="en-gb"><br>
