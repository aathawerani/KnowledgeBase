 DECISION  ACTION1.2 The proposal of Dr. Nasir Touheed to revise the academic calendar was not accepted. However, the Committee decided that in future the Academic Calendar would be prepared by the Academic Committee. DECISION2.5 The Committee decided that a temporary wall with minor work should be raised. In the meantime Mr. Mahmood Ali would ask Mr. Shabih of NBCL to prepare a design for the boundary wall after which advertisement should be placed and the short-listing of petty contractor for a period of two years completed (if the validity of earlier short listed petty contractors expired) as the Maintenance Department would also need the services of petty contractors.
