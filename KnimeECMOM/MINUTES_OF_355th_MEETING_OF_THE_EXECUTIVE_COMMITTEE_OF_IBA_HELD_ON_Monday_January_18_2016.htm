and Mr. Sharaf Hussain would carry out a survey on making available centralized 
common services such as printing, fax machine and scanner on each floor and 
making a person responsible for such services: </b>Mr. Sharaf Hussain reported 
that universities like LUMS, NUST, Bahria, and IQRA are using the centralized 
printing services because of the physical setup. Their faculty members sit in a 
hall and they have their cubicles but at IBA every faulty member has got a 
separate room. He said that they can arrange the printing facilities at 
corridors. He further reported that since Feburary 2016, ICT will implement an 
online system for toner issuance which would help them to determine the need of 
centralized printing services on the basis of six months data. To a question he 
clarified that the above mentioned universities do not charge from faculty for 
printing but students are given a quota. </span></font></p>

suggested that limits may be set for the number of toners issued to faculty 
members beyond which faculty members may either be required to pay or to justify 
their issuance. &nbsp; Regarding the students, Dr. Sayeed Ghani said that the roaming 
profiles were tested last semester whose results have been determined to be 
satisfactory. He said that during Spring 2016 all students will be issued 
roaming profiles. Subsequently printing limits will be set for each student per 
academic year. He reported that for October 2014 – September 2015, the total 
pages printed from Lab printers were about 280,000; on average it comes to 75 
pages per student. Based on this, he recommended that the limit of 100 pages (on 
grey scale) per year per student or 50 pages for semester be set. Students 
exceeding the limit will be blocked further printing unless they have specific 
approvals from concerned approving authority.</span></font></p>

said that if we are going to move towards a paperless system then we should 
gradually reduce printing; instead of 50, we should allow 25 pages per semester. 
This will give a strong signal forcing economy in usage. The teachers should 
also upload their course material. Dr. Nishat said that LMS usage will have to 
be increased. The Dean &amp; Director suggested that the students should be 
communicated about the printing limit. Mr. Imran Batada said that students 
printing limit would be implemented from April 2016. Mr. Abdul Wajed suggested 
that faculty should also start taking paperless assignments. &nbsp;Dr. Sayeed Ghani 
suggested that there should be an app through which faculty members may make 
corrections, give their remarks on the assignments submitted by the students.&nbsp;

include the feature of temporary partition in the design of the lab for the 
purpose of online exams. Mr. Sharaf Hussain said that provision for partition 
would be made in the furniture design. The Dean &amp; Director suggested that it 
should be temporary partition not permanent. He also advised Mr. Abdul Wajed to 
encourage faculty members to take online exam. He suggested that everything 
should be automated gradually. He said that online exam system should be 
separate from everything else and its security should be more strengthened 
compared to other systems. He asked Mr. Imran Batada to design online exam 
system from scratch with built in security features in collaboration with the

estimate for gym he would need couple of weeks more. He wanted to know if the 
indoor games suggested to be accommodated in the existing canteen, can be 
shifted to Aman Tower because of shortage of space at the existing canteen. The 
Dean &amp; Director said that at 11<sup>th</sup> floor temporary arrangement can be 
done. The Registrar said that the frequent shifting would be cumbersome and 
damage the equipments too. The Dean &amp; Director asked if it can be arranged at 
FCS Building. The Registrar said that on the basement of FCS Building opposite 
ATM where cars are parked, space can be provided for the indoor games. He said 
that he along with Mr. Moeid would visit the site.&nbsp; Mr. Abdul Wajed suggested to 
convert the opposite side into a store which is very much needed. He said that 
presently the store is on the roof and its passage is narrow. The Dean &amp;

Sultan said that the EC had decided in its earlier meeting that top 10% students 
on merit list of entry test would get the scholarship in the first year only. In 
2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year those who are on the 
Dean’s List would get scholarships equivalent to 50% applicable tuition fees. He 
said that earlier those who were maintaining a CGPA of 3.5 or above were given 
this scholarship in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year. 
He said that for this year there would be overlap between the existing 
recipients and the new ones on the Dean’s List. This would require an additional 
budget allocation of around Rs.8. million. The Dean &amp; Director said that it 
would be the transition period; from next year whosoever makes it to the Dean’s 
List in 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year will get the 
merit scholarship. Mr. Moeid said that the stated policy would be applicable 
from Fall 2016; for academic year 2015-16 they have to absorb the remaining 76 
students on the Dean’s List. The Dean &amp; Director said that the Dean’s List is 
very stringent so anybody who qualifies on the Dean’s List is more deserving 
than those who have secured 3.5 CGPA.&nbsp; He said that it should be announced that 
the criterion of 3.5 CGPA for award of merit scholarship in years 2 to 4 will 
not be applicable from Fall 2016 and only those regular full time program 
students who are on the Dean’s List would be eligible for it.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

Rs.3000 to Rs.4000 but the exact amount would be ascertained. Mr. Khalid Rishi 
said that the reader has got two options: thumb and digits. If we do not use 
card then we may use thumb. Mr. Batada said that the thumb machine is integrated 
with ERP but when RFID card is introduced the thumb machine will no longer be 
used. The Dean &amp; Director said that in transition period both systems should be 
operational. He further said that whatever the system is it should be 
multi-functional with compatibility features. He said that students attendance 
should be integrated with ERP module in second phase. &nbsp;He said that the cards 
should allow only restricted access to users. He asked as to who would provide

4.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Imran Batada said that they have implemented several systems (ERP,

challenge is the utilization. He said that t</span><span lang="EN-GB">he systems 
are completely integrated with each other. If a proper entry is not being made 
its effect will appear in other modules such as enrolment numbers, registration 
numbers or in the financials.&nbsp;He said that to overcome this challenge, they have 
developed a Task Management System Application that will identify the task at 
the micro level. Tasking System provides a platform for managing and tracking 
tasks assigned to the employees. This Tasking system enables Managers to have 
detailed and up-to-date project schedule to direct team members accordingly and 
move the project forward. By utilizing this web based application, the team will 
know what they have to do, when it must be done and who needs to do it. This 
Tasking system also includes email alerts which are sent to the 
Managers/Supervisors as well as to task incharge when the tasks are created in 
the system. He said that the t<span style="background: white">asking system 
incorporates all the business processes that are being followed in IBA to 
accomplish routine tasks. This tasking system will benefit us in enforcing 
proper utilization of all the online systems (ERP, LMS, HRMS etc.) that are 
being developed and maintained by ICT team. Effective use of Tasking system will 
enable them in maintaining data accuracy and reliability and will also help in 
identifying and evaluating potential resources which can contribute in progress
