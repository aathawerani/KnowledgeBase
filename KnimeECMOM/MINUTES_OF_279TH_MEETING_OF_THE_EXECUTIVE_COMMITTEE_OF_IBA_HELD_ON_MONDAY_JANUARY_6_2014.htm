		is licensed product and we have to pay licence cost on yearly basis. He 
		said that ICT team and Dr. Khoja are exploring other open source 
		solution(s) as well. However, he said that open source is not up-dated 
		with the speed as others do. He said that a minimum of five licences

		for five licences and the same amount is the annual recurring fee. He 
		said that the equipment cost would be between Rs.3 to 4 lacs per 
		licence. He said that there is a provision in the budget for such 
		expenses. <br>
		<br>
		The Registrar suggested to reserve one licence for Aman Tower. He 
		further suggested that one class room at Aman Tower should have 
		Electronic Board. Mr. Batada said that Panopto can be integrated to 
		Smart Board/Electronic Board also. The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Batada

		be interested to work for small projects because some of them are very 
		large companies. Mr. Moeid Sultan suggested to award all the four 
		projects to one contractor as it would be more economical for both the 
		contractor and the IBA. The Dean &amp; Director asked about the status of 
		the MP Building facade. The Director Projects said that the tender 
		document for uplifting the facade of MP Building is ready. He said that 
		preparation of tender documents of the two projects namely; transport 
		building, and clinic would take one month’s time. He said that the work 
		on the existing canteen will be given to a small contractor. The 
		Registrar suggested to award two projects; transport building and clinic 
		together and the third one i.e. up-lifting of MP Building facade 
		separately. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director Projects to request 
		NBCL to prepare tender documents for the three projects as soon as 
		possible.<br>
