<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Mr. Mahmood Ali, Senior 
Manager Projects, and Mr. Amin Ashraf Qureshi, Manager Projects attended the 
meeting on special invitation.<br>
<br>
The following items were discussed:<br>
<br>
<b>Item No.1 To consider and approve design and cost estimate of Gate Nos. 1 &amp; 4 
of IBA Main Campus.</b> <br>
<br>
1.1 Mr. Mahmood Ali informed the members that the following provisions were 
proposed in Gate # 1, and Gate # 4: <br>
<br>
<b>Gate No. 1</b><br>
<br>
1. Guard Room<br>
2. Students Entrance Hall<br>
3. Reception &amp; Waiting Hall<br>
4. One Toilet for Reception Area<br>
5. One Toilet for Staff<br>
6. Changing Room.<br>
7. Entry / Exit Gate<br>
<br>
<b>Gate No. 04</b><br>
<br>
1. Guard Room<br>
2. Security Check Room<br>
3. Storage Room<br>
4. Entry / Exit Gate<br>
<br>
1.2 Mr. Mahmood Ali said that the Engineer’s estimate for Gate No. 1 is Rs.5.628 
million, and for Gate No. 2 it is Rs.5.276 million. Thus the total estimate for 
the two gates is Rs.10.904 million. He said that an additional amount of Rs.1.5 
million would be required for works such as dismantling of existing structure, 
clearing and grubbing of site, security fencing, pathway, kerb stone, band 
plaster and other minor works shown in drawing but not included in BoQ. He 
further said that earlier when they had obtained average bid cost of Gate # 4 
from two different contractors it was Rs.7.0 million for Gate # 4 only. On the 
basis of above average bid the estimated cost of 2 Nos. of gates comes to 
Rs.14.50 million. He requested the Executive Committee to approve the design and 
the Estimated Cost of Rs.14.50 million including all type of contingencies.<br>
<br>
1.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that there was no need of toilets at Gate No.1. As 
and when needed the toilets at Fauji Foundation Building can be used. He 
suggested to remove the two toilets from the drawings. He also suggested to 
combine Students Entrance Hall, and Reception &amp; Waiting Hall and reduce the 
covered area. He said that there was no need of façade at Gate No.1; only Gate # 
4 is to be uplifted with new façade. <br>
<br>
1.4 The Dean &amp; Director asked as to why Storage Room has been provided at Gate 
No.4. The Registrar said that to keep vehicle check gears, mirrors and other 
equipment a small storage room was required. <br>
<br>
1.5 The Dean &amp; Director said that according to the estimate, the per square foot 
rate is around Rs.5,000/- . He said that for the masonry and civil work he would 
not allow more than Rs.2,000/- per sft. He said that for the roof separate rate 
should be charged. He clarified that the rate for covered area should be 
exclusive of the roof and elevation. He asked Mr. Abdul Rahman to resubmit the 
revised drawings and cost estimate.<br>
<br>
DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
<br>
1.6 Mr. Abdul Rahman would get the drawings revised incorporating the 
suggestions noted above and re-submit the revised drawings and cost estimate to 
the EC for approval. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Item No.2 To consider and approve the recommendation for ex-post facto 
approval for Activity Based Reward to Mr. Muhammad Abid Husain, and Mr. Muhammad 
Waseem. </b><br>
<br>
2.1 The Registrar said that the Executive Committee in its 328th meeting held on 
January 12, 2015 while considering the Activity Based Reward, had approved 
Letter of Appreciation for Mr. Muhammad Abid Husain and Mr. Muhammad Waseem, 
Electricians. However, he said that due to oversight on his part he could not 
pursue their case for monetary reward. <br>
<br>
2.2 The Registrar recommended that in view of the fact that both of them had 
played a very integral role in the energising of the MAC Lab and the efforts 
that they continue to make for saving cost and resources for IBA including their 
current efforts in making power available for the twin JS and Aman Tower 
Buildings, the EC may give ex-post facto approval for a cash reward of Rs.3000/- 
for each of the two Electricians.<br>
<br>
DECISION<br>
<br>
2.3 The Committee approved ex-post facto approval for a cash reward of 
Rs.3,000/- each to Mr. Muhammad Abid Husain, and Mr. Muhammad Waseem.<br>
<br>
<b>Item No.3 Reconsideration of the proposal for “Standardization of Tissue 
Papers”. </b><br>
<br>
3.1 The Dean &amp; Director said that the Manager Purchase &amp; Stores had earlier 
submitted a proposal to the EC in its 322nd meeting for Standardization of 
Tissue Papers which was not approved by the EC. He wanted to know the reasons 
for which the EC did not approve the proposal as he was not present in that 
meeting. <br>
<br>
3.2 The Registrar said that they had examined the proposal. There were the 
following three reasons: <br>
<br>
1) Rose Petal’s availability is limited as its manufacturer is in Lahore, <br>
2) Due to bulk purchase the fragrance and wetness of tissue papers are lost with 
the passage of time, and <br>
3) As the tissue paper boxes as are non-compressible, they would require much 
space to stock.<br>
<br>
3.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that there would be no issue of availability as we 
can procure direct from the manufacturer. He said that Rose Petal is a quality 
tissue paper. He said that as a general principle the EC should give more 
consideration to cost saving and value for money. He said that if we can procure 
directly from the manufacturer why should we pay additional costs to the 
middlemen. He further said that in order to overcome the space problem, the 
tissue papers can be procured twice or thrice a year. He suggested that in order 
to make storage space available, the old records should be disposed of following 
the government rules for disposal of material. <br>
<br>
3.4 Mr. Moeid Sultan said that on Standardization Government auditors raise 
objection on selecting a particular brand. However, he said that where there is 
saving without compromising on the quality we should go for that. <br>
<br>
DECISION<br>
<br>
3.5 The Committee allowed standardization of tissue papers (Rose Petal) and 
their procurement direct from the Manufacturer M/s. Packages Limited. The 
procurement order can be issued twice or three depending upon the requirement 
and availability of space. <br>
<br>
There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of thanks to 
the Chair.<br>
