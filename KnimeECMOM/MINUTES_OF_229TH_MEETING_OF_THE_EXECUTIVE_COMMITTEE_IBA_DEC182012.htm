			schools. International schools along with British and Cambridge 
			schools should be selected and they be sent details of our programs, 
			requirements for admission to these programs, and the facilities 
			available. Depending upon the response from the selected schools, we

			Girls’ Hostel is not expected to be ready by the time the fall
