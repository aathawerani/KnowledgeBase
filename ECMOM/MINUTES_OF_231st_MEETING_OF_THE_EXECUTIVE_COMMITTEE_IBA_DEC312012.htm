				The 231st meeting of the Executive Committee of IBA was held on 
				Monday, December 31, 2012 at 9:30 a.m. at Breakout Room, 
				Aman-CED Building, IBA Main Campus. The following were present:<br>
				<br>
				1. Dr. Ishrat Husain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean &amp; Director<br>

				8. Dr. Arshad Siddiqi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director ICT<br>
				<br>
				Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects, and Mr. Fahad Jawed, 
				Manager Finance attended the meeting on special invitation.<br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. To consider and approve the construction of Spiral 
				Stair Case at the Administration Building at City Campus.</b><br>
				<br>
				1.1 The Director Projects said that while main stair case on the 
				southern side of the Academic Block, City Campus, was being 
				removed, it was proposed that a spiral stair case may be 
				constructed to provide the fire escape as well as the access to 
				the class rooms and video conference room, the ‘Gents Bath Room’ 
				on the ground floor. He said that the Architects M/s. ICON have 
				designed spiral stair case. He presented the drawing along with 
				the engineers’ estimate. He said that the Architects did not 
				include the installation of the rubberized vinyl sheets to cover 
				the treads of the staircase which are very essential for the 
				safety of the users. As such approximate amount of Rs. 42,000/- 
				has been added to the estimate.<br>
				<br>
				1.2 The Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to 
				approve the estimate of Rs.160,000/- so that the tenders for the 
				spiral stair case may be invited along with the tenders of the 
				store rooms and Workshop for which the designs and estimates 
				have already been approved. He said that the Budget is available 
				from the Administration Building budget, financial closure of 
				which has not yet been completed due to a dispute with the 
				contractors M/s ZCL.<br>
				<br>
				1.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that there is already a stair case 
				which is being used and that is serving the purpose well. He 
				said that in his opinion there is no need of another stair case. 
				Mr. Mobin Khalili also agreed with the Dean &amp; Director. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				1.4 The Committee did not approve the proposed stair case. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 To consider and approve the award of work to the 
				lowest bidder for supply and installation of Sewage Treatment 
				Plant.</b><br>
				<br>
				2.1 The Director Projects said that this item was presented in 
				the last EC meeting where it was decided that the Consultant and 
				the Project Managers who have evaluated the bid documents should 
				be invited to satisfy the EC that there would be no compromise 
				on the quality of equipment and work if the contract is awarded 
				to the lowest bidder. He said that representatives of NBCL, and 
				NESPAK have been invited, as desired by the EC.<br>
				<br>
				2.2 Mr. Shabih Haider of NBCL said that there are two components 
				in STP; Civil, and MEP. For MEP, the engineer’s estimate was 
				Rs.11 million whereas the lowest bidder quoted Rs.10.5 million 
				which was very close to the engineer’s estimate. For the civil 
				section, there was a variation and the lowest bidder quoted 
				Rs.3.4 lesser than the engineer’s estimate. He said that when 
				they made a detailed comparison they found major variations in 
				two items; excavation and concrete for which they under-quoted. 
				He said that one of the reasons may be that the other three 
				bidders who quoted the high price are joint ventures involving 
				greater overheads and profits. He said that the standard 
				practice is that before award of contract they hold a meeting 
				with the contractors and ensure that the contractor follows the 
				drawings, and BoQ. He said that in this case also they would 
				obtain written confirmation of compliance from the contractor.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.3 To the observation that EC needed to ensure that IBA does 
				not get substandard equipment, the representative of SMC said 
				that they specified three or four companies’ equipment and the 
				equipment mentioned by the lowest bidder is one of them which is 
				acceptable. Moreover, they would get an undertaking from the 
				Contractors that the contractors would comply with the 
				specifications. The representative of NESPAK added that the 
				submittals would be obtained prior to the letter of award.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				2.4 Having been satisfied with the clarifications given by the 
				Architect and Project Manager, and based on the recommendations 
				of the Technical Evaluation Committee and Central Purchase 
				Committee, the Executive Committee recommended to the A&amp;FC to 
				approve the award of work to the lowest evaluated bidder M/s. RM 
				Gulistan Engineers &amp; Contractors at a cost of Rs.20, 866,109/- 
				for the supply and installation of Sewage treatment plant at IBA 
				Main Campus.<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Director Projects would ensure that an undertaking from 
				the Contractors that they would comply with the specifications 
				and the submittals are obtained prior to issuance of the work 
				order. He would present the recommendation of EC to the A&amp;FC for 
				approval.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 3 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>a) Waiver of penalty imposed on Wateen.</b><br>
				<br>
				3.1 The Director ICT said that the laying of optical fibre cable 
				between various network segments in IBA, was executed by M/s 
				Wateen. However, due to various other projects in progress at 
				IBA, and related constraints, the optical fibre project couldn’t 
				continue at the pace with which it was supposed to. Timelines 
				couldn’t be met, resulting in significant delay in completion of 
				the project. The delay was mainly due to the reasons, as 
				outlined below:<br>
				<br>
				1. As mentioned above, various construction projects are 
				currently under progress at IBA, due to which ground level is 
				uneven at various places. It was advised by Projects to ICT to 
				lay the cable through aerial route, as it wasn’t possible at 
				that time to lay the cable underground. This advice was 
				particularly followed to avoid any delay to commission the 
				network in the upcoming finished building projects. It was 
				further assured by Projects Department that laying the optical 
				fibre through underground channel shall be covered in the scope 
				of external development work undertaken by Projects. <br>
				<br>
				2. Another major factor which was the cause of significant delay 
				in the said project was the permission from Karachi University 
				for digging the trench through their premises for laying fibre 
				optic from IBA Main Campus to hostels and staff colony. We 
				continually followed up the matter with the KU. Meanwhile as the 
				matter was discussed with the Director HEC Projects, he informed 
				that he had already taken permission from Karachi University for 
				digging of a 36 inch trench for IBA for various development 
				works. The Director ICT said that when he asked the Director HEC 
				Projects if they can use the trench for laying of optical fibre, 
				the Director HEC Projects, after discussing the matter with Dean 
				&amp; Director, replied in the affirmative.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Director ICT said that as stated above the overall delay 
				in completion of the Optical Fibre project was totally due to 
				the reasons beyond our control and there was no delay on part of 
				M/s Wateen. The laying of optical fibre at City Campus was 
				completed as per the plan and there was no delay of any sort in 
				completion of that particular phase of the project. Furthermore, 
				M/s Wateen have favoured IBA many times by putting extra efforts 
				and doing work which was beyond their scope, for example, laying 
				of Optical Fibre Cable in Aman CED Building, connecting Optical 
				Fibre from new boys’ hostel to the old hostel etc. However, as 
				per the contract a delay penalty of 2% is to be imposed upon 
				Wateen, even though the delay was not caused by Wateen. He 
				requested the EC to waive off the penalty imposed on M/s Wateen, 
				for delay in completion of the project of laying of optical 
				fibre cable between various network segments of IBA.<br>
				<br>
				3.3 Mr. Shameem Ahmed clarified that Wateen was given a contract 
				for laying optic fibre cable from Main Campus to hostels and 
				staff colony but permission for digging could not be obtained 
				from Karachi University. In the meantime, he said that they got 
				permission from Karachi University for laying pipeline through 
				the same way from where optic fibre cable was to be laid. He 
				said that they used the same trench for both optic fibre and the 
				pipeline. <br>
				<br>
				3.4 The Dean &amp; Director said that if the Director ICT is 
				convinced that the delay was due to the circumstances beyond 
				control and there was no fault of Wateen then he should have 
				taken action accordingly. Mr. Fahad Jawed said that when the 
				delay was anticipated it should have been taken during the 
				execution of the project to the CPC for time extension because 
				auditors raise objections if the project is not completed on the 
				agreed time period.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.5 The Committee decided that it is not a case of waiver of 
				penalty rather it is a case of extension of time through CPC.
				<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				3.6 The Director ICT would request the CPC with full 
				justification for extension of time in the completion of the 
				project.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>b) To consider leave request for Ms. Maha Khan, student of BBA-I</b><br>
				<br>
				3.7 The Registrar said that he has received an email from the 
				cousin of Ms. Maha Khan, a student of BBA-I in which she has 
				reported that Ms. Maha Khan’s brother, Shahzeb Khan, was shot 
				dead on 25th December, in a cross fire by unknown assailants. He 
				was 20 years old and was on his way back from his eldest 
				sister’s valima. This is an untimely, shocking death for the 
				family and both his mother and sister Maha, are in shock as they 
				saw the murder happen from their building balcony. It was 
				reported that the family is under medical care and the doctors 
				have recommended rest and a week-long dosage of 
				anti-depressants. <br>
				<br>
				3.8 The Cousin of Ms. Maha requested a week off for Ms. Maha 
				from 29th December to 6th January 2013 with the hope that she is 
				out of shock and able to appear in her exams from 7th January. 
				During this time she will not be able to attend any classes or 
				appear for presentation/quizzes. It was requested to allow her 
				to appear in these tests/quizzes/presentation later.<br>
				<br>
				3.9 The members were aggrieved to know that the deceased Shahzeb 
				Khan was the brother of Ms. Maha Khan and prayed that Almighty 
				Allah give the bereaved family ample courage and fortitude to 
				bear this irreparable loss. <br>
				<br>
				3.10 Mr. Mobin Khalili suggested that Ms. Maha may be convinced 
				to appear in the final exam as there is a gap between the 
				incident and the final exam. He said that since it would be the 
				semester final exam, as per rule make-up is not allowed. He said 
				that if she is not in a position to appear in the final, then 
				‘I’ may be given. However, he said that it would be difficult to 
				re-arrange quizzes and presentation. The Registrar suggested 
				that the average marks of the previous quizzes should be 
				considered for the missed ones and the absences should be 
				condoned. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.11 The Committee requested the Registrar to talk to Ms. Maha 
				Khan and see if she can appear in the final exam, otherwise, ‘I’ 
				would be given to her. The Committee further decided that Dr. 
				Muhammad Nishat would talk to the concerned teachers and advise 
				them to award the average marks for the quizzes / presentation 
				she would miss. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>c) Landscaping for prayer hall and other places:</b><br>
				<br>
				3.12 The Director Projects said that to create greenery around 
				the Prayer Hall he has received a proposal from the Architects 
				M/s NBCL for the landscaping along with its estimate and its 
				financing through the same donor. He said that earlier they had 
				removed this item from the Prayer Hall BOQ, as it was to be 
				included in the Master Plan, but then that was also removed from 
				the Master Plan while doing Value Engineering Exercises. The 
				estimated amount for the landscaping is Rs.1.7 million, which 
				can be reduced to Rs.1.5 million. He said that the donor has 
				agreed to further donate for the landscape based on two points:<br>
				<br>
				1. IBA acknowledges them for this further contribution.<br>
				2. IBA commits to maintain the landscaped area in years to come.<br>
				<br>
				3.13 The Director Projects said that if the Committee agrees to 
				the two points he would ask the donor to directly pay to Mrs. 
				Anjum Pervaiz, so that the work could be done expeditiously. <br>
				<br>
				3.14 The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Fahad Jawed to show the 
				increased amount of donation for Prayer Hall by the donor. Mr. 
				Fahad Jawed said that a letter committing the additional Rs.1.5 
				million would be required from the donor. <br>
				<br>
				3.15 The Dean &amp; Director said that landscaping around the prayer 
				hall is part of the project; landscaping elsewhere will be part 
				of the external development project. The Director Projects 
				informed that the external development work at Main Campus will 
				start from 1st of January 2013 and that of City Campus will 
				start in March 2013. The Dean &amp; Director suggested that the 
				sequence should be such as the parking lot of CED be developed 
				first and then the ring road connecting CED so that by that time 
				all the heavy traffic movement will be over. The Dean &amp; Director 
				asked the Registrar to execute, in consultation with the 
				Director Projects, the landscaping plan prepared by the 
				Architects. He also advised the Registrar to identify green 
				patches where grass is to be laid and employ the IBA staff to 
				work on these patches. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.16 The Committee decided to acknowledge for the additional 
				amount to be paid by the donor directly to Mrs. Anjum Pervaiz 
				for the landscaping around the Prayer Hall and to maintain the 
				landscaped area in the years to come.<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				3.17 The Director Projects would obtain acceptance letter from 
				the donor for the additional amount. On receipt of the 
				acceptance letter, Mr. Fahad Jawed would increase the amount of 
				donation by the additional amount. <br>
				<br>
				3.18 The Registrar, in consultation with the Director Projects, 
				would execute the landscaping plan prepared by the Architects 
				and identify green patches where grass is to be laid and employ 
				the IBA staff to work on these patches.<br>
				<br>
				3.19 The Director Projects would develop the parking lot of CED 
				first and then the ring road connecting CED.<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair. <br>
