		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The following attended the meeting on 
		special invitation:<br>
		<br>
		1. Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed, Manager Operations &amp; Maintenance <br>
		2. Mr. M. Rehan Shaikh, Senior Manager Projects<br>
		3. Mr. Nabeel Hassan Shaikh, Assistant Engineer<br>
		<br>
		The following items were discussed: <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.1 <u>Follow-up presentation on Employees’ Data regarding 
		promotions. <br>
		</u></b><br>
		1.1 Mr. Adnan Hameed said that in the last EC meeting the members were 
		briefed on the three types of promotion namely; (i) Promotion through 
		appointment, (ii) Promotion through up-gradation of position, and (iii) 
		Seniority based promotion; the third one is applicable for 
		non-management staff. However, he said that in the last meeting, the EC 
		felt that there are some people on senior positions who have not been 
		promoted for a long period of time. The EC had also decided to review 
		and revise the third pillar of promotion to allow seniority cum merit 
		based promotion for BPS-16 and above and equivalent employees and 
		present it to the Selection Board and BoG for approval. <br>
		<br>
		1.2 The Dean &amp; Director said that we have to be consistent with and 
		follow what the government rules of promotion are and the same rules 
		should apply for BPS as well as Job Band employees in the equivalent 
		scale. He wanted to know as to what is the minimum service length 
		required under government rules for promotion from BPS-17 to 18 and 
		onward. Mr. Moeid Sultan reported that the HEC Promotion Policy requires 
		five years of experience for promotion to the next grade. <br>
		<br>
		1.3 Mr. Adnan Hameed presented details of the employees for 
		consideration for promotion from BPS-17 to 18 / Job Band 3 to Job Band 
		4, and BPS-16 to 17 / Job Band 2 to Job Band 3. The Committee, in 
		addition to the data provided by H.R., referred to the minutes of the 
		Selection Board in order to reconfirm the date of last promotion. The 
		Committee also considered the Job Analysis carried out in 2011 and 
		approved by the Selection Board / Board of Governors, and the annual 
		performance appraisal. <br>
		<br>
		1.4 Out of the list of 17 employees in BPS-17 / Job Band 3, the 
		Committee, on the basis of length of service in the existing grade/Job 
		Band, above average reports at Annual Performance Evaluations, and 
		educational qualifications found two of them – Mr. M. Akmal Khan, and 
		Mr. Abdul Khalid eligible for consideration.<br>
		<br>
		1.5 Similarly, for promotion from BPS-16 / Job Band 2 to BPS-17 / Job 
		Band 3, two employees – Mr. Khurram Khalid, and Mr. Ayaz Ahmed met the 
		eligibility criteria. However, Mr. Adnan Hameed reported that Mr. 
		Khurram Khalid’s case was already being separately considered for 
		promotion (as a member of the Audit Department). Mr. Ayaz had previously 
		served in different departments and his performance was above average.
		<br>
		<br>
		1.6 For promotion from the position of Senior Executive Job Band 1 to 
		Assistant Manager, Job Band 2; three employees: Syed Sohail uddin, Syed 
		Akbar Hussain Kazmi, and Ms. Ghulam Fatima met the eligibility criteria 
		and were found suitable for promotion.<br>
		<br>
		1.7 The Dean &amp; Director sought members’ comments / assessment on the 
		potential of each of the employees who were meeting the eligibility 
		criteria.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		1.8 The Committee finally recommended the following to the Selection 
		Board for consideration and approval for promotion:<br>
		<br>
		a) Mr. M. Akmal Khan from BPS-17 to BPS-18<br>
		b) Mr. Ayaz Ahmed from BPS-16 to BPS-17<br>
		<br>
		c) Syed Sohail Uddin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		} <br>
		d) Syed Akbar Hussain Kazmi } From Job Band 1 to Job Band 2<br>
		e) Ms. Ghulam Fatima&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		}<br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.9 The Head of H.R. would present the proposed amendment in the 
		Promotion Policy as noted in 1.1 and 1.2 above as well as the amendments 
		suggested in the previous EC meeting (287th meeting held on March 10, 
		2014) to the Selection Board and BoG for approval.<br>
		<br>
		1.10 The Head of H.R. would present the recommendations for promotion / 
		up-gradation (including the recommendations made in the previous EC 
		meeting held on March 10, 2014) to the Selection Board for consideration 
		and approval.<br>
		<br>
		1.11 The concerned Department Heads would convey to the above 
		recommended candidates the feedback of EC with regard to the need for 
		improvement of their communication skills/confidence level and nominate 
		them for the required courses/trainings. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 2 <u>To consider and approve the extension of time for Simab 
		(smc) Pvt. for furniture of new Girls’ Hostel at IBA Staff Town.<br>
		</u></b><br>
		2.1 The Director Projects reported that SIMAB had finished delivery of 
		all items and materials at site as per the project timeline. The 
		installation work had been completed except for two items which were 
		pending due to delay in approvals from client side. He stated that the 
		delay in procurement of kitchen equipment led to deletion of kitchen 
		cabinets and ventilation hood from Simab’s scope of work. Similarly 
		laundry cabinets were also delayed and eventually deleted from scope of 
		work due to delay in procurement of laundry driers and washers from STHP 
		funds. Meanwhile, the Registrar IBA had requested Simab to urgently 
		arrange 4 single seater sofa, 2 three seater sofa, 2 centre tables and 4 
		sofa side tables for inauguration ceremony which were later adjusted in 
		the bill as extra item. This led to more delays in final bill on the 
		project. He reported that the Procurement Committee has approved the 
		extension of time and recommended it to the Executive Committee. The 
		Director Projects requested the EC to consider and give approval 
		accordingly. To a question he said that there had been a delay of seven 
		months however, he clarified that is no financial impact involved in it.
		<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		2.2 The Committee endorsed the recommendation of the Procurement 
		Committee for the extension of seven months time for Simab (smc) Pvt. 
		for the supply of furniture for new Girls’ Hostel at IBA Staff Town.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.3 <u>To consider and approve the extension of time and 
		revision in cost for Electrical Power Infrastructure Development Work at 
		IBA Staff Town, New Girls’ and Boys’ Hostels. <br>
		</u></b><br>
		3.1 The Director Projects reported that the work was awarded to 
		contractor M/s Iqbal Engineering House through letter of Acceptance / 
		Award No. IBA-MC/HEC-Projs/231/0529/2012 dated January 07, 2013. As per 
		the contract the date of commencement was established as January 23, 
		2013 and the whole work was to be completed within 150 calendar days 
		i.e. up-to June 21, 2013. But the work could not be completed in due 
		time because of various reasons. He informed the EC that the Contractor 
		M/s Iqbal Engineering House had submitted the reasons for delays vide 
		his letter dated July 23, 2013, which were also examined in detail by 
		the Project Manager NESPAK and the Project Manager recommended 82 days 
		of time extension to the contractor i.e. upto September 11, 2013. The 
		time extension recommended by Nespak is mentioned as following:<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Occasional Hold-ups due to Law and Order Situation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 09 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Delay Due to General Election in the Country&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 02 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Change in Design (Manufacturing of LT Panels)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 36 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Removal of Existing Cable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 10 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Additional Scope of Work (Owner Supplied Item)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 25 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Energization from KESC (Procedural Delays)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recommended 21 days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Total: 103 Days Recommendation<br>
		<br>
		3.2 The Director Projects reported that the time extension was 
		recommended by Nespak on August 21, 2013 before the actual completion of 
		work. At that time the anticipation was that the remaining work would be 
		completed smoothly without any major obstruction and therefore IBA 
		accordingly provided the plan to KESC to Energize Boys’ Hostel on August 
		20, 2013 &amp; Staff Colony on August 27, 2013 but KESC energized both the 
		schemes on September 11, 2013. The delay occurred because KESC rejected 
		initially to energize the IBA schemes because IBA didn’t fulfil the PFIP 
		installation requirement as per approved load at the Main Campus. IBA 
		had committed earlier to do that. Later on with the intervention of IBA 
		higher management the matter was resolved amicably with KESC/K-Electric. 
		This whole exercise delayed the process and the construction schedule 
		was disturbed badly. The remaining work i.e. dismantling of cable in 
		KU’s premises could only be executed after the energization of Boys’ 
		Hostel scheme. Thereafter, the cable could be laid in the staff town. 
		Due to this reason the sub-project got further delayed by 21 days and 
		was completed on September 30, 2013. <br>
		<br>
		3.3 The Director Projects reported that the project also faced the issue 
		of cost overrun as the approved quantities in BOQ didn’t cover the whole 
		requirement of work and additional quantities had to be procured adding 
		12.26% to the cost. Besides the quantities variation in the project, 
		some additional works were also performed by the contractor which 
		amounted to 7.16% of the project tender cost; these works became 
		necessary due to the actual site conditions that required viability, 
		functionality and protection of the project. <br>
		<br>
		3.4 The Director Projects further reported that another issue faced was 
		the shortage of cables of 240 sq mm and 95 sq mm. The matter was 
		referred to CPC in its meeting held on June 08, 2013. The CPC approved 
		the request and decided that the requirement was genuine and direct 
		contracting could be done. As per the decision of CPC the contractor 
		procured the cables at the discounted rates which were offered by the 
		Manufacturer to IBA. The cable was procured through the existing 
		contractor but at a discounted rate negotiated by IBA considering the 
		urgency of the matter and to save time on other activities of the 
		project which could suffer badly if required cables were not procured on 
		time. The overall cost impact of cable procurement with respect to 
		tender cost is 11.85%. <br>
		<br>
		3.5 The Director Projects reported that the above case was submitted to 
		Procurement Committee in its meeting held on March 15, 2014. The 
		Procurement Committee recommended the Extension of Time and the cost 
		overrun up to 15% to the EC for approval. For the cost overrun exceeding 
		15% limits, the Procurement Committee recommended that the case of cost 
		overrun should be revalidated by the Competent Authority of IBA i.e. 
		Audit &amp; Finance Committee, duly recommended by the Executive Committee.<br>
		<br>
		3.6 The Dean &amp; Director said that the variation order arising out of the 
		items that were not included in the original BoQ should be treated 
		separately. He said that the additional work carried for with 
		justifiable reasons cannot be labelled as cost overrun. He said that the 
		cost of work mentioned in the original BoQ did not exceed the 15% limit. 
		However, during the implementation of the project, it was discovered 
		that there was a shortage of cable because the old dug out cable was not 
		of the dimension which was needed to link with the feeder. We did not 
		have any drawings available of the old cable lines. The procurement of 
		new cable of required dimension was therefore inevitable. Because of the 
		urgency and in order to avoid the delay the work was given to the 
		existing contractor. This was an unanticipated development and the 
		approval for procurement of cable in emergency was obtained from CPC. He 
		said that according to the original BoQ the variation is within 15% and 
		the additional unanticipated work which had to be procured in emergency 
		was part of External Development Work not of the Hostel project itself. 
		He suggested to separate the unanticipated External Development work 
		from the Hostel projects.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		3.7 The Committee endorsed the recommendation of Project Manager NESPAK 
		for allowing 82 days time extension i.e. upto September 11, 2013 to the 
		Contractor.<br>
		<br>
		3.8 The Committee recommended to the A&amp;FC to approve the variation 
		orders which are within the limit of 15%.<br>
		<br>
		3.9 The Committee also recommended to the A&amp;FC to approve the additional 
		unanticipated work carried out in emergency as part of the External 
		Development Work in the staff colony. <br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		3.10 The Director Projects would present the recommendations of 
		Procurement Committee and the Executive Committee on the variation 
		orders and the additional unanticipated work done in emergency with 
		complete justifications to the A&amp;FC for approval. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 4 <u>To consider and approve the award of work to the lowest 
		evaluated bidder for uplifting of Multipurpose Building facade at IBA 
		Main Campus. <br>
		</u></b><br>
		4.1 The Director Projects stated that advertisement for

		Badar Engineering.<br>

		4.6 The Dean &amp; Director asked if M/s. Badar Engineering have worked with 
		IBA on any project. The Director Projects said that the company has not 
		worked with IBA. However, he said that the Architect is of the opinion 
		that M/s. Badar Engineering are capable of executing the work which is 
		straightforward. The Architect had seen the sample work done by M/s. 
		Badar Engineering on the facade of Multipurpose Building and was 
		satisfied. The Director Projects clarified that the work does not 
		include interior decoration work. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director 
		Projects to prepare a package of interior decoration work and place 
		tender for it. <br>

		<b>Item No. 5 <u>Progress Report on Aman Tower.</u><br>
		</b><br>
		5.1 The Director Projects presented the summary of the project and the 
		progress of the project as of March 17, 2014. He presented the current 
		status of Phase I, II &amp; III and the cost involved in each activity. He 
		said that initially the tender cost quoted by Contractors for Internal 
		Development package was Rs.333 million which, because of reengineering 
		exercise, was reduced to Rs.219 million and is expected to be reduced 
		further. He said that Phase I works were scheduled to be completed by 
		March 31, 2014 but for various reasons, it got delayed by one month and 
		will now be completed by end of April 2014. He confirmed that the delay 
		will not cause any day in the final completion as they will be 
		dovetailed with the interior design works (Phase II) and will be 
		completed within the scheduled time for Interior Development Works. The 
		Dean &amp; Director asked as to when all the work of Phase-I will be 
		completed. The Director Projects said that all the work in Phase-I 
		(civil and MEP) will be completed by June 24, 2014. <br>
		<br>
		5.2 The Dean &amp; Director asked as to why so many standby generators have 
		been proposed while there is an assurance from KESC that IBA would be 
		exempt from load shedding and we already have a 500 KVA and three 125 
		KVA generators as stand-by at the City Campus. The Registrar said that 
		if there would be any breakdown that would be for a very short period 
		for which one generator could be sufficient. The Dean &amp; Director said 
		that there is a 500 KVA generator which can be dedicated to Aman Tower. 
		He asked the Director Projects to remove the gen set from the tender 
		documents in process. The Director Projects said that the tender will 
		have to be cancelled. The Dean &amp; Director said that this will save Rs.40 
		million which was being spent on new generators that overlapped with the 
		existing one. Mr. Mushtaq said that he has three generators of 125 KVA 
		each and the another one has become very old. The Dean &amp; Director said 
		that the old one can be replaced with 250 KVA generator in the next 
		budget. He asked Mr. Mushtaq to dedicate a 500 KVA generator to Aman 
		Tower for meeting essential requirements in case of power breakdown. He 
		asked him to do zoning and set priority for the Aman Tower as he has 
		done for the Main Campus. Mr. Mushtaq said that there is no need to move 
		the generator; Aman Tower would be connected through cable. However, he 
		said that he would check the essential load requirements and inform the 
		EC. <br>
		<br>
		5.3 The Director Projects said that as there would be saving, they may 
		go for the bridge to connect the two buildings. The Registrar said that 
		its estimated cost is Rs.200 million. He said that there is no need of a 
		bridge; stair cases will be sufficient. The Dean &amp; Director agreed that 
		stair cases will serve the purpose and a bridge is not required.<br>
		<br>
		5.4 The Director Projects said that furniture design has been completed 
		by EA Consulting and is under review at IBA. He said that the furniture 
		work will start from May 2014 and the target dates are set as follows:<br>
		<br>
		a) Phase – I All furniture except residences by end of October 14, 2014<br>
		b) Phase – II Residences furniture by December 31, 2014.<br>
		<br>
		5.5 The Dean &amp; Director advised the Director Projects to share the 
		design of furniture with the clients; Director CEE, Registrar, Associate 
		Deans, Controller of Examinations, Head Librarian and expedite the 
		tendering process.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		5.6 The Committee noted the status on Aman Tower and decided that there 
		was no need of spending Rs.40 million on stand-by generator and the 
		existing 500 KVA generator would be dedicated to Aman Tower. <br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		5.7 The Director Projects would cancel tender for standby generators, 
		and would expedite the tendering process for furniture. <br>
		<br>
		5.8 Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed would study and examine the essential load 
		requirements of electricity at Aman Tower and present his report to the 
		EC. <br>

		6.1 After the EC meeting the members visited the under-construction Aman 
		Tower. The Registrar advised Mr. Rehan Shaikh to take appropriate 
		measures in advance for stopping accumulation of rainy water in the 
		basement (due to slope) as according to Meteorological Department’s 
		forecast heavy rain is expected in May and June this year. <br>
