<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b>Item No.1 <u>To 
consider and approve the cost impact of Project Management Fee for External 
Development Works at IBA Main Campus. </u></b><br>
<br>
1.1 The Director Projects said that in the last EC meeting while approving 
extension for three months to the External Development Works at IBA Main Campus, 
the EC had asked to submit the cost impact of Project Management Fee for the 
extended period. <br>
<br>
1.2 The Director Projects informed the Committee that M/s NESPAK were awarded 
the work for Project Management Services of External Development works at IBA 
Main Campus @2.95 % of the contract value. According to the contract agreement 
the following works were included in the scope of NESPAK and the cost of Project 
was fixed as Rs.115 million:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • External Development works<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Sewage Treatment Plant <br>
<br>
1.3 The Director Projects reported that as per contract the total project 
management fee was Rs.3.3925 million and according to the contract 70% of the 
fee (Rs.2,374,740) was being paid in equal monthly installments during the 
execution period of 18 months. The per month instalment is Rs.131,390/- The 
Project Managers fee cost impact for extended three months is (3 months x 
Rs.131,390 per month) = Rs.394,170/- He said that as agreed by M/s NESPAK, they 
would give 20% discount on additional fee i.e. Rs.78,834. Thus the total impact 
of Project Management Fee for 3 months would be Rs.315,336/- He requested the 
Executive Committee to approve the cost impact and the extension of 3 months to 
Nespak.<br>
<br>
DECISION<br>
<br>
1.4 The Executive Committee approved the extension of three months to M/s Nespak. 
However, in view of the fact that M/s Nespak are working on so many projects of 
IBA, the Executive Committee requested the Director Projects to get waiver of 
the Project Management fee of Rs.315,336/- from M/s NESPAK.<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Project</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting Faculty Hostel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
5.9 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rs. 8.03 million <br>
<br>
2.4 The Director Projects said that the amount appears exorbitantly high and it 
would be appropriate to form a Claim Settlement Committee of Finance Department 
to study the details of the claim and see if the claim is justified or not. He 
said that the fee of M/s. CTI as per contract is as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting Faculty Hostel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Girls Hostel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Rs.3,136,246/-</u><br>

Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Rs.10,241,021/-</b><br>
<br>
2.5 The Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to advise further 
action in the matter. The Registrar suggested to settle the claim by giving 
Rs.1.5 million as suggested by Mr. Shameem Ahmed. The Director Projects informed 
the Committee that the Consultants have not accepted this offer and the matter 
is under dispute since the days the Director HEC Projects was in office. He 
further informed that he had also argued with the Consultants but they remained 
firm on their claim. The present calculation has been submitted by them in 
response to his request which is 22% lower than the original claim. The Director 
Projects stated that this claim is still very high and needs to be properly 
scrutinized by an independent committee. The Executive Committee then should 
consider the payment on the recommendation of the proposed Claim Settlement 
Committee. Mr. Moeid Sultan suggested that Mr. Syed Jehanzeb and a person from 
Projects Department should be included in the Claim Settlement Committee. He 
also suggested that the TOR of the Committee by given by the Director Projects.
