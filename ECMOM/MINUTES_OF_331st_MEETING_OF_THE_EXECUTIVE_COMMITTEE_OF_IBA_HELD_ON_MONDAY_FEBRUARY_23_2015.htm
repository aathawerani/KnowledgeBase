<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Mr. Abdul Rehman, Senior 
Manager Contracts attended the meeting on special invitation.<br>
<br>
The following items were discussed:<br>
<br>
<b>Item No.1 Status Reports from:</b><br>
<br>
<b>Registrar:</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.1 Shed for the motorcycle stand:</b> The Registrar reported that two stands 
are planned; one each behind Fauji Foundation Building and one behind Power 
Center Building. As the work forms a part of the external development work the 
shed design has been forwarded by Projects Department to the Architect.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Dismantling of overhead bridge between APWA and IBA and to be used for 
watch tower at Main Campus:</b> The Registrar said that he had earlier presented 
the proposal to the EC under the impression that the bridge was gifted to IBA by 
the then Mayor, Karachi Metropolitan but in fact it is the property of 
Cantonment Board and the Cantonment Board would decide whether the bridge is to 
be dismantled or relocated. <br>
<br>
<b>1.3 The Registrar to invite Pizza Hut and show them the kitchen at Aman Tower 
and get their requirements incorporated in the kitchen:</b> The Registrar said 
that the requirements were earlier incorporated; now it is the part of physical 
component. He said that they were awaiting cafeteria floor to take shape and 
observe operation of the facility at Main Campus. He said that the Pizza Hut at 
Main Campus is on three months’ trial period and they are operating like a 
kiosk. He said that if they find it feasible then they would be provided space 
at Aman Tower.<br>
<br>
<b>1.4 The Registrar to provide a team of house keeping to Mr. Noshad for 
getting the Library cleaned:</b> The Registrar said that the work at Library is 
still on and Mr. Noshad has not yet requested for the team. He expected the team 
would be required by mid of March, 2015. He said that there is a standard system 
that once the project is fully completed, it is handed over neat and clean but 
in our projects the Maintenance Staff is requested to clear the debris and clean 
the building. The Registrar felt that buildings, maintenance and security should 
only be taken over when they are properly handed over and are ready for being 
occupied. Presently, in his opinion the contractor was saving money in cleaning 
and site clearance and getting it done from maintenance, just because we wanted 
to him to expedite the handing over.<br>
<br>
Mr. Imran Batada agreed that no project has to date been formally delivered. He 
said that if there is any issue, it is difficult to know as to who would solve 
that issue. He said that recently there was an issue with ICT nod which took 10 
days to resolve, because projects had not yet completed tagging of the wiring 
such as in case of Fauji Building. <br>
<br>
<b>1.5 The Registrar to check if the Water Tanker can be available early morning 
before the traffic comes to the Karachi University:</b> The Registrar reported 
that the tanker operator who had agreed to provide the service is reluctant as 
it was not practicable due to non availability of hydrant or pumping facility / 
arrangement at the bulk water supply for the gravity filling of tanker, which is 
the correct method of filling the tankers. Tanker owner has expressed inability 
for suction by tanker of the water from tank as it would take sufficient time 
also he has no pumps available. Direct flow from the main line is not possible 
as there are no valves and the pressure is too high. Therefore, substantial 
civil and plumbing works required for installation of hydrant including valves 
and supports which would require an estimated amount of Rs.399,000/-. He said 
that if the pump is used, it would take three hours to fill a tanker and seven 
round trips in a day are not possible in the agreed rental time.<br>
<br>
Dr. Sayeed Ghani felt that if Rs.300,000 to Rs.400,000 is required for the civil 
and plumbing for the installation of hydrant; we should go ahead with it as it 
would give saving in long term. The Registrar said that he would find out the 
details of the cost involved and how much savings could be made and report to 
the EC.<br>
<br>
<b>Head of ICT:</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.6 Business Intelligence System:</b> Mr. Imran Batada reported that they had 
incorporated all the changes suggested by the EC and the project has been 
completed.<br>
<br>
<b>Mr. Abdul Rahman:</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.7 Mr. Abdul Rahman to re-submit the drawings and cost estimate of Gate 
Nos.1 and 4 to EC:</b> Mr. Abdul Rahman reported that the observations of EC 
were sent to Architect and as advised by the Dean &amp; Director in weekly progress 
review meeting held on February 16, 2015 the Architect is to prepare and submit 
final documents of Gate no 4 separately for tender. He said that tender for Gate 
No.4 would be issued in a week. Design of Gate No.1 will be submitted after 
incorporating observations of EC later.<br>
<br>
<b>Mr. Mahmood Ali:</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.8 Construction of outer boundary wall at Main Campus:</b> The EC was 
informed that conceptual design with cost estimate was ready. After review by 
the Project Department the same would be presented in EC.<br>
<br>
<b>Head of H.R.</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.9 The Head of H.R. to manage the database of TAs and prepare a standard 
format covering the duty, and accomplishment of TAs:</b> Mr. Adnan Hameed 
reported that they have started to manage database of TAs. <br>
<br>
Dr. Nishat asked if it is possible that the TAs enter their assignment and the 
concerned faculty member verifies it. Dr. Sayeed Ghani also suggested that 
concerned faculty should verify the assignment completed by the TA, but the 
faculty member should not enter the details. Mr. Imran Batada replied that it 
was not possible to make changes at this stage because it would require a lot of 
customization. He said that from control point of view also it is not 
recommended. He requested that for one semester they should be allowed to see 
how it works. After one semester, if needed, changes would be made to allow TAs 
to enter their assignments in the system. The members agreed. <br>
<br>
<b>1.10 Mr. Adnan Hameed to request Mr. Mahmood Ali to prepare tender for the 
furniture including vanishing blind for the Boys’ Hostel:</b> Mr. Adnan Hameed 
reported that he conveyed the decision to Mr. Mahmood Ali. However, he said that 
there is no furniture in this project; its tender is done separately. Mr. Abdul 
Rahman clarified that it is not in the project but the previous specs for 
furniture for the Boys’ Hostel can be replicated. <br>
<br>
<br>
DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
<br>
1.11 The Registrar would report to the EC after finding out as to how much cost 
is involved in civil and plumbing works required for installation of hydrant 
including valves and supports and how much savings could be made after this 
arrangement.<br>
<br>
1.12 Design of Gate No.1 will be submitted by Mr. Abdul Rahman after 
incorporating observations of EC later.<br>
<br>
1.13 After review by the Project Department the conceptual design with cost 
estimate for the outer boundary wall at Main Campus would be presented in EC by 
Mr. Mahmood Ali.<br>
<br>
<br>

installation of 500 KVA Generator at Aman Tower, IBA City Campus. </b><br>
