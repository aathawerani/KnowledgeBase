  been changes in the main power&nbsp;supply mode from KESC because of which

  there was a misunderstanding that the existing KESC connection and new
  connection would be merged but these cannot be merged. The Dean &amp;
  Director wanted to know as to why it cannot be merged. Mr. Shameem Ahmed
  replied that KESC sub-station it is not fully dedicated to IBA as two other
  institutions of Karachi University are also getting supply from there.  Mr.
  Khalid Pervez said that as a precautionary measure, when they did value
  engineering they checked again with building consultant if there was any
  change in the demand. He said that the Consultant intimated in writing that
  there was a demand of additional 539 KW for CED, Academic Block, Student
  Centre and for UPS.     </span></p>

  Dean &amp; Director said that the additional demand has to be justified.
  Moreover, he said that KESC has put IBA on zero load shedding. He wanted to
  know as to what will be the difference between the design and maximum demand
  ignoring the additional demand.   Mr. Khalid Pervez said that there is an
  increase of 39% in the total load.  He said that design is based on 80% maximum
  load utilization of the connected load.  The Dean &amp; Director said that if
  we reduce the maximum utilization load from 80% to 70% the additional projected
  demand of 39% would no longer be valid. Mr. Khalid Pervez agreed with the
  Dean &amp; Director. To a question Mr. Khalid Pervez said that if in future
  there is a substantial increase in load, then we may change the circuit
  breaker.   &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>6.4     Mr.
  Khalid Pervez said that due to continuity of existing KESC substation, the
  two 750 KVA transformers, related 11 KV switchgear and MV cable were
  eliminated. This necessitated addition of LV cables to bring power of standby
  generators from power centre to the electric room where distribution of 400
  KW LV power of KESC was planned. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>6.5     To
  give a specific example, the Dean &amp; Director said that the initial load
  for the Academic Block as reflected in the BoQ was 506 KW but now it has been
  raised to 715 KW, which is not needed because 506 KW will meet the
  requirements. Mr. Khalid Pervez requested to give mandate of maximum demand. 
  The Dean &amp; Director said that as a client he thinks that the load
  utilization included in the original BoQ is O.K. However, if technically the
  electrical consultants want to review then they may do so.  The Director
  Projects said that in the work order of Rs.109 million it was 500 KW but
  later after re-calculating the load factors, NBCL gave new loads of 715 KV so
  cables were procured for 715 KV. He said that they would see if cable of 550
  KV or 715 KV is needed. The Registrar said that the original plan was of 500
  KV but because of generator of 750 KV, cable was procured of 750 KV load. The
  Dean &amp; Director said that the additional cable from City Campus was also
  placed here. The Director Projects said that it was connected with multipurpose
  building to energise UPS and this cable cannot be used here. Mr. Khalid
  Pervez said that the cable which is needed is different in size and length
  from the one brought from City Campus.&nbsp;</span></p>
