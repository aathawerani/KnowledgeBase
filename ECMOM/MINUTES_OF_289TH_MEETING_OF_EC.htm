		1.1 The Registrar said that at the instruction of the Dean &amp; Director he 
		visited LUMS and stayed at their Rausing Centre on March 13 and 14, 
		2014. He said that the purpose of his visit was to meet and network with 
		the persons responsible for General Administration &amp; Security functions, 
		and to visit the facilities with specific focus on the following areas:</font></p>

		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.2 The Registrar stated that by 
		staying there he got the opportunity of knowing about their day to day 
		administration and operations of the Rausing Centre, House keeping, and 
		the Dining Hall facilities. He presented the layout of facilities on 
		LUMS according to which the facilities are situated on a 100 acre plot 
		with roads on all four sides. Out of 100 acres, 60 acres have been 
		allocated for instructional facilities, 20 acres for residential 
		facilities, 15 acres for extra-curricular, technical and sports 
		facilities, and 5 acres are unutilized. The total capacity of Boys’ 
		Hostel is 1200 studens and for girls 600 students. However, at the 
		moment there are 250 girls staying in the girls’ hostel. IBA has a total 
		area of 72 acres which is divided into five different locations; Main 
		Campus (31 acres), City Campus (3.43 acres), Staff Colony (35 acres), 
		Boys Hostel (1.10 acres), and Nazimabad Plot (1.7 acres). <br>
		<br>
		1.3 The Registrar said that on his visit to LUMS facilities, he got the 
		following observations and impressions:<br>

					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Being 
					located in the safe environs of the DHA and having all 
					facilities within one boundary makes the administration and 
					security of the LUMS campus easier to manage in comparison 
					to IBA’s dispersed facilities with campuses located in 
					congested and sensitive environments.</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
					architectural design and materials used in the IBA 
					buildings, interiors and furnishings present a modern look 
					comparable to International Standards; the same therefore 
					gives all our buildings a distinct edge over the LUMS 
					buildings which lack in ambiance, aesthetics and décor and 
					interiors.</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With 
					residential, instructional and extra-curricular facilities 
					being co-located within one boundary for both faculty and 
					students, the LUMS campus remains more populated round the 
					clock. This facilitates profitable management of the 
					catering and food vending facilities on a round the clock 
					basis including providing three times meals for the hostel 
					residents in the executive dining center supporting the REDC.</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overall 
					capacity of LUMS hostels is several fold that of IBA – 
					albeit at the cost of reduced privacy for hostélites as the 
					bulk of the accommodation in the hostels is on twin sharing 
					basis. In IBA we have single rooms in the Boys’ Hostel. The 
					common use facilities at LUMS Hostels are not of the same 
					standard as at IBA.</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of 
					spaces at LUMS are open hall type allowing them to be 
					configured for multi use; for instance the foyers become 
					assembly areas, play courts and even lecture theatre. Also 
					some of the lecture / discussion rooms have removable 
					partitions.</font></li>

		presentation of the Guest Room, Writing Corner, Pepsi Dining Hall, 
		Seminar Rooms at LUMS as well as at IBA. He also showed visuals of 
		Access Point/Cash counter, Food Counter in Pepsi Dining Hall, Front 
		Office, Garbage Disposal arrangement, Donated benches etc. He said that 
		there is very effective use of walkie talkie by Security Staff at LUMS. 
		Students use pre-paid Smart Card for using canteen; they cannot enter 
		into cafeteria without making payment at the counter either through 
		smart card of cash payment. <br>
		<br>
		1.5 Addressing the Buildings Incharge the Dean &amp; Director said that the 
		buildings are now ready but they are to be maintained in the best 
		possible way. We should learn from others too. He said that day to day 
		operation is better known to incharge of respective buildings. He said 
		that we should follow the best practices and see what further 
		improvement can be made. He asked them to give their comments / 
		suggestions.<br>
		<br>
		1.6 Mr. Abdul Karim Modi suggested that there should be a separate 
		budget for maintenance for each building. He suggested that spare parts 
		should be in ready stock so that time is saved in repair and maintenance 
		as and when needed. Mr. Ayatullah suggested that Petty Cash should also 
		be provided to the building incharge for meeting urgent need related to 
		repair and maintenance. The Dean &amp; Director said that Mr. Mushtaq will 
		ensure availability of the spare parts that would be required in 
		emergency. He said that there would be a separate budget for maintenance 
		of each building and petty cash would also be provided. However, he said 
		that the donors who are trustees of the Endowment Fund would have to be 
		convinced for providing fund for the maintenance of buildings. The funds 
		would be managed by the Board of Trustees and we have to go to the Board 
		of Trustees for approval of the Maintenance &amp; Operations budget. <br>
		<br>
		1.7 The Dean &amp; Director said that after 2014 when all the facilities 
		including Aman Tower are ready, the Maintenance Department will have to 
		be re-organized. He asked the Registrar and the Director Projects to 
		assess what should be the structure of our maintenance department, what 
		is to be outsourced, what is to be kept in-house. A Maintenance Manual 
		has to be prepared including the schedule for periodic, routine, and 
		emergency maintenance along with chart of responsibilities.<br>
		<br>
		1.8 Mr. Abdul Karim Modi reported that there has been seepage on the 
		ground and first floors of Aman-CED building but the cause could not be 
		detected. The Director Projects said that water pipe line was broken 
		which has been replaced. Mr. Modi said that the seepage is at places not 
		at one place. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director Projects to 
		investigate and fix the problem.<br>
		<br>
		1.9 Mr. Abdul Karim Modi pointed out that the glasses of the buildings 
		specially of the upper portion are not being properly cleaned by the 
		outsourced firm. Mr. Faheem said that due to building structure 
		scaffolding cannot be used as its stand requires 4 to 5 feet space which 
		is not available due to keyari or water body. He said that the same 
		problem is being faced at VPR. He said that there is a company which 
		makes adjustable stand for scaffolding and our outsourced company – 
		Master Multitech - is in contact with them. The Director projects said 
		that there is an electric operated scaffold with hydraulic system 
		available in the market. He suggested to procure that for IBA. The Dean 
		&amp; Director said that the IBA should have its own equipment provided it 
		is economical. <br>
		<br>
		1.10 Based on his visit and observations at LUMS the Registrar made the 
		following recommendations to the EC for consideration: </font></p>

		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.11 The Dean &amp; Director suggested that 
		on completion of the Aman Tower, IBA should float a consolidated tender 
		for food and beverages for all the buildings, boys’ and girls’ hostels, 
		VPR, Main Campus and City Campus so that on the basis of larger volume 
		of business, good vendors at reasonable price may compete. The Director 
		Projects said that the kitchen at Aman Tower is not so big and 
		therefore, the existing cafeteria at the City Campus can be used as 
		kitchen.<br>
		<br>
		1.12 The Registrar said that there are safes in all the rooms at Rausing 
		Centre in which people may keep their laptop and personal belongings. 
		The Dean &amp; Director said that at Aman Tower Guest Rooms we can provide 
		the safes and should also have a counter. He said that our alumni can be 
		asked to sponsor small items too like benches and they can sponsor even 
		the existing benches.<br>
		<br>
		1.13 The Dean &amp; Director said that on completion of Aman Tower they will 
		have to revisit the locations of campuses for different program 
		offerings. He said that FCS and Executive Education may be located at 
		City Campus.<br>
		<br>
		1.14 It was agreed that IBA should also have Smart Card for our students 
		and staff and the Building Access system should be introduced. The 
		suggestion of providing a rest room and a wash room next to the faculty 
		lounge at Adamjee Academic Centre was also appreciated. In regard to 
		squash courts some suitable space has to be identified in the future.
		<br>
		<br>
		1.15 The cleaning and mopping should be done before and after the 
		working hours so that the janitorial staff are less visible during 
		working hours. <br>
		<br>
		1.16 The Dean &amp; Director asked the Registrar to visit Aga Khan 
		University also. The Director Projects suggested to include electrical, 
		civil and mechanical people in the team for visit to AKU. <br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		1.17 The Committee approved the recommendations along with suggestions 
		noted above.<br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.18 The Registrar and the Director Projects to assess what should be 
		the structure of our maintenance department after 2014, what is to be 
		outsourced, what is to be kept in-house, prepare Maintenance Manual 
		indicating the schedule – periodic, routine, and emergency along with 
		chart of responsibilities. The Director Projects will assist in the 
		preparation of Maintenance Manual also.<br>
		<br>
		1.19 The Director Projects would investigate the seepage issue at 
		Aman-CED Building and get it fixed.<br>
		<br>
		1.20 The Director Projects would suggest the economically viable 
		equipment / scaffolding for cleaning of glasses of all IBA buildings.<br>
		<br>
		1.21 The Director Projects would suggest space for two squash courts 
		along with estimated expenditure. He would also arrange to provide Rest 
		Room at Adamjee Building.<br>
		<br>
		1.22 The Registrar would arrange and provide safes at Guest Rooms at 
		Aman Tower.<br>
		<br>
		1.23 The Alumni office would advise IBA alumni to sponsor small items 
		too like benches and they can sponsor even the existing benches.<br>
		<br>
		There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of 
		thanks to the Chair.<br>
