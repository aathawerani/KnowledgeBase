				<br>
				The following attended the meeting on special invitation:<br>
				<br>
				1. Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects<br>
				2. Engr. Abdul Mateen of NESPAK<br>
				3. Mr. Waseem, Representative of H.K. Shah<br>
				4. Mr. Mansoor Ali, Network Manager<br>
				5. Mr. Imran Batada, Senior Manager IS (Through phone)<br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 1 To consider and approve the extension of time and 
				escalation in the cost of the project “Laying of Water 
				Transmission Line”. </b><br>
				<br>
				1.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that the project of Laying of Water 
				Transmission Line was conceived and approved in 2008, which 
				included:<br>
				<br>
				(a) taking an independent water connection for IBA direct from 
				Karachi Water and Sewerage Board. (This was necessitated due to 
				acute shortage of water at the Main Campus, especially in the 
				summer when the University reduced the water supply to IBA).<br>
				<br>
				(b) construction of underground and overhead tanks of 100,000 
				and 50,000 gallons capacity respectively and their ancillary 
				requirements at the Staff Colony, and<br>
				<br>
				(c) laying of underground water transmission pipelines from the 
				KW&amp;SB main trunk line (located within the University premises) 
				upto the underground water tank in the Staff Colony and from the 
				overhead tank there upto the Main Campus and Boys’ Hostels.<br>
				<br>
				1.2 On approval of the new water connection by KW&amp;SB, NESPAK was 
				hired by IBA as a consultant-cum-project manager. NESPAK was 
				required to do all designing, prepare tender documents and, on 
				award of the contract, provide detailed supervision and 
				project-management services. After following all prescribed 
				procedure the work was awarded to the successful (lowest and 
				responsive) bidder, Samad Khan Babar &amp; Co., on 20-10-2010, at 
				the bid price of Rs.36,764,101/- The contractor commenced 
				execution of the work on January 1, 2011 and was required to 
				complete it in 10 months on October 31, 2011. However, the 
				project execution according to the original design encountered 
				unusual difficulties and obstacles of various nature right from 
				the very beginning. These included lack of adequate pressure at 
				water head in the KW&amp;SB’s main trunk line, strong resistance by 
				encroachers to laying the intake water pipeline along the 
				University-approved right-of-way (Raah-e-Salim), 
				non-availability of the corridor originally approved by the 
				University for laying the pipeline from the Staff Colony to 
				Boys’ Hostels, re-routing the pipeline (in consultation with 
				University’s Master Planner, ECIL) and its delayed approval by 
				the University, etc.<br>
				<br>
				1.3 Mr. Shameem Ahmed further said that in addition to what has 
				been stated above, as electrical power for CED building was 
				urgently needed, a then-and-there decision had to be made to lay 
				the KESC HT cable in the same trench that had been dug for 
				laying the water pipeline from the Staff Colony to Boys’ Hostel. 
				Besides, almost simultaneously, the ICT department approached 
				and asked them to let their contractor Wateen to lay fiber optic 
				cable in the same trench from the Staff Colony to Boys’ Hostel. 
				The fiber optic cable laying had also been earlier delayed 
				unduly due to non-availability of permission from the 
				University. He said that they had no choice but to allow it in 
				IBA’s interest. He said that they faced extreme pressure from 
				HEJ and the University to fill the dugout trench and re-carpet 
				and restore the road to its original condition. As a result of 
				these unforeseen developments, not only the project completion 
				got delayed inordinately, but its cost also has escalated. It 
				has doubled from Rs.36.764 million to Rs.76.336 million. The 
				project is no longer the same as was designed originally and for 
				which tenders were invited.<br>
				<br>
				1.4 Mr. Shameem said that complete details in this regard have 
				been prepared by the project manager, NESPAK and they at his 
				request, have agreed to make a presentation of the same before 
				the EC. What is requested through the presentation is an 
				approval of Extension of Time and the escalation in the cost of 
				the project.<br>
				<br>
				1.5 Mr. Shameem reported that the case was presented to the CPC 
				in its meeting held on January 12, 2013. The CPC referred the 
				case to the EC.<br>
				<br>
				1.6 The Dean &amp; Director said that the Director HEC Projects did 
				not tell him during this period that he had got any problem in 
				the execution of this project. He said that it is difficult to 
				raise extra money to finance the additional cost.<br>
				<br>
				1.7 Engr. Abdul Mateen of NESPAK said that the project was 
				conceived in 2008 and started towards end of 2010. He said that 
				as the project execution proceeded, it started running into 
				serious problems. He said that the original design was based on 
				at 20 feet pressure head at the connection point which was also 
				confirmed by KW&amp;SB but when they actually carried out the 
				testing they found that the Water Board had provided pressure of 
				8 feet instead of 20 feet. As 8 feet pressure cannot work for a 
				2500 feet pipeline they had to switch to gravity flow. For this 
				purpose the minimum depth of the trench required was 12 feet 
				which they had to redesign. He said that after laying 550 feet 
				line the work had to be stopped for the following reasons:<br>
				<br>
				• The service corridor provided for laying of transmission line 
				at Raah-e-Saleem had already been occupied by 36” dia water 
				line, and 4” dia gas line. These two were so closely located to 
				each other that it was difficult to lay 6” dia water line in the 
				same corridor due to space constraints. <br>
				<br>
				• Along the provided alignment, a number of encroachments are 
				located i.e. houses and boundary wall and other structure. As 
				the encroachers refused to remove their structures, the laying 
				of pipe line along the approved alignment / corridor at 11 feet 
				depth was no longer possible. <br>
				<br>
				• Work on water supply line from overhead water tank to IBA 
				Boys’ Hostel could not be started and remained held-up for six 
				months because the service corridor having only 3 feet width 
				provided by Karachi University for laying of transmission line 
				at Road had already been fully occupied with existing services 
				i.e. KESC sub-station, electric poles, optical fibre, manholes &amp; 
				other structures. Due to this laying of pipe line in the 
				allocated service corridor at 5 to 6 feet depth was not 
				possible. <br>
				<br>
				1.8 Engr. Abdul Mateen said that it was suggested to find an 
				alternate route and it took six months to find a different route 
				but it was also saddled with encroachments. Then they proposed 
				to lay the pipeline in the centre of the road with the 
				coordination of the Karachi University. This decision was 
				confirmed and approved. He said that they have placed three 
				utilities in the same trench; water pipeline, optical fiber and 
				the KESC high tension cable which was not originally planned but 
				which was needed urgently. He also said that because of this 
				there has been considerable saving for IBA. <br>
				<br>
				1.9 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to how much has been 
				saved for the three jobs done together. The Director ICT said 
				that for Optic Fiber they had Rs.1 million. <br>
				<br>
				1.10 Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that for high tension line they have 
				given Rs.66 million to KESC and the KESC assigned this job to 
				their sub-contractors to lay the pipeline. The Dean &amp; Director 
				said that KESC used our trench and we paid the whole amount to 
				KESC. He said that it was the responsibility of KESC to dig the 
				trench but it was provided by IBA. He asked Mr. Moeid Sultan to 
				see as to what provisions exist in the original contract with 
				KESC in this regard. <br>
				<br>
				1.11 Engr. Abdul Mateen said that 1800 feet line is held up and 
				out of that 550 feet have been completed. He said that now they 
				would take it diagonally. The Dean &amp; Director said that the 
				recurring cost for repairs will have to be paid by IBA if dig up 
				the road for one reason or the other. <br>
				<br>
				1.12 Engr. Abdul Mateen said that due to change in design five 
				variation orders have been placed. He requested the EC to 
				approve the extra/additional work amounting to Rs.39.27 million.
				<br>
				<br>
				1.13 The Dean &amp; Director said that he has no problem in 
				extending the time but he wanted to know as to who authrorized 
				the expenditure above Rs.36 million without the approval o the 
				necessary bodies. Mr. Shameem Ahmed replied that he had no 
				realization that the cost was escalating so much. He further 
				said that the five variation orders are additional items and 
				they are not included in the original BoQ. The justification for 
				these orders has been provided by the Project Manager i.e. 
				NESPAK.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				1.14 The Committee constituted a sub-committee comprising the 
				Director Projects, the Director Finance and the Chairman CPC. 
				The Committee would thoroughly analyze the case and give its 
				recommendation to the EC in its next meeting. The Director 
				Projects who would be the convenor of this sub-committee will 
				also invite Engr. Abdul Mateen of NESPAK to the meeting of the 
				sub-committee. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 To consider and approve the award of construction 
				of Power Centre Building to the lowest evaluated responsive 
				bidder. </b><br>
				<br>
				2.1 The Director Projects reported that the tenders were floated 
				to already pre-qualified contractors for the External 
				Development works as the construction of Power Center is also a 
				part of External Development works. Following contractors 
				collected the Tender documents during the given duration:<br>
				<br>
				1. M/s Venture Crest<br>
				2. M/s SMK Construction<br>
				3. M/s DR Construction<br>
				4. M/s Hasscon Services<br>
				5. M/s United Construction<br>
				6. M/s Saadullah Khan &amp; Brothers<br>
				<br>
				Except M/s. Saadullah Khan &amp; Brothers all the above named 
				contractors submitted the documents and participated in the 
				further tendering process. The following five bidders submitted 
				their bids and their bids were opened in front of their 
				representatives, Project Manager NESPAK representative, NBCL 
				representative and IBA officials. At the time of bid opening the 
				following rates were quoted by the contractor and announced in 
				front of all present:<br>
				<br>
				1. M/s Hasscon Services Rs.15,052,000/-<br>
				2. M/s DR Construction Rs.15,516,971/-<br>
				3. M/s Venture Crest Rs.17,457,749/-<br>
				4. M/s United Construction Rs.22,233,478/-<br>
				5. M/s SMK Construction Rs.25,070,532/-<br>
				<br>
				The Bid Documents and Technical details of the contractors were 
				sent both to M/s NBCL and M/s NESPAK for their scrutiny and 
				Evaluation. M/s NESPAK and M/s NBCL submitted their reports. As 
				per their reports they corrected the arithmetical errors of M/s. 
				SMK Construction which was Rs.23,070,532/- and not 
				Rs.25,070,532/-. The rest were correctly calculated. <br>
				<br>
				2.2 Based on the above rates and given details both Project 
				Manager M/s. NESPAK and Project Architect M/s. NBCL recommended 
				M/s. Hasscon Services as the lowest evaluated bidders and 
				recommended IBA to award the work at a cost of Rs.15,052,000/- 
				The case was presented in TEC on January 23, 2013 which 
				recommended the award of work to the lowest bidder M/s. Hasscon 
				Services. Based on the recommendations of Project Managers (M/s. 
				NESPAK), Project Architect M/s. NBCL and the Technical 
				Evaluation Committee the case was presented to the Central 
				Purchase Committee on 26th January 2013. The Central Purchase 
				Committee, after due scrutiny, recommended the award of work to 
				the lowest evaluated responsive bidder M/s. Hasscon Services at 
				a cost of Rs.15,052,000/-<br>
				<br>
				2.3 The Director Projects reported that there were two technical 
				observations raised by the members of the Technical Evaluation 
				Committee as well as the CPC regarding provision of Fire 
				suppression system and the surveillance system. He said that the 
				fire alarm system provision is in the contract of electrical 
				infrastructure whereas the provision for conducting of 
				surveillance cameras is already a part of contract. He further 
				said that the Consultants have been asked to design the fire 
				suppression system and let them know the cost. That can be taken 
				care of independently. The Director Projects requested the 
				Executive Committee to approve the award of work to the lowest 
				evaluated responsive bidder as detailed above. He said that 
				Rs.16 million is available in the budget for this under the head 
				of External Development Fund. He said that the Power Centre 
				Building would be constructed behind the AMAN-CED Building. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				2.4 The Committee recommended to the A&amp;FC to approve the award 
				of construction of Power Centre Building to the lowest evaluated 
				responsive bidder M/s. Hasscon Services at a cost of 
				Rs.15,052,000/-. <br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Director Projects would get the work done in 
				coordination with Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed, Manager Operations &amp; 
				Maintenance, after obtaining approval from A&amp;FC. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 3 To consider and approve the continuation of NBCL 
				Consultancy Services for Phase 2 of the New Boys Hostel. </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				3.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that IBA hired Najmi Bilgrami 
				Collaborative (Pvt.) Ltd. (NBCL) for providing consultancy 
				services for construction of New Boys’ Hostel, Phase 1, 
				comprising the Front Block and Block A, at a fee of 4% of the 
				total value of the project (approx. Rs.140 million). The project 
				has been completed recently and handed over to IBA 
				Administration. The Phase 1 rooms have already been occupied by 
				newly-admitted students.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 In view of the expected demand for more hostel 
				accommodation, Mr. Shameem said that the EC in its meeting held 
				on December 18, 2012, directed that we should go ahead for 
				construction of Phase 2 of the hostel which comprises Blocks B &amp; 
				C which will accommodate 216 students. <br>
				<br>
				3.3 Mr. Shameem reported that the proposal was presented to the 
				CPC to approve retaining NBCL as a consultant for Phase 2, on 
				the same 4% fee of the cost of the project. It is a natural 
				continuation of the previous assignment where continuity of 
				services is important and required. The CPC considered and 
				approved the proposal. Mr. Shameem requested the EC to approve 
				it, too. He said that the cost of the project has not yet been 
				determined. However, it is estimated to be about Rs.130 million.<br>
				<br>
				3.4 The Dean &amp; Director said that NBCL had prepared the designs 
				of the three blocks. He said that if we have to repeat the 
				block, then why should we pay again. <br>
				<br>
				3.5 The Director Projects said that additional work such 
				detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents have to 
				be carried out by the Consultants. He suggested that we can ask 
				them to reduce the fee. Mr. Zafar Siddiqui agreed with the 
				Director Projects and advised Mr. Shameem Ahmed to convince BBCL 
				to agree at 2%. The Dean &amp; Director asked Engr. Rehanul Ambia to 
				talk to NBCL in this regard.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.6 The Committee decided that the Director Projects would talk 
				to NBCL to reduce the fee for the B &amp; C blocks of the new Boys’ 
				Hostel. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 4 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.<br>
				</b><br>
				a) Revision in Completion date of Tier III Data Centre at IBA 
				City Campus. <br>
				<br>
				4.1 The Director ICT said that he has invited Mr. Waseem of H.K. 
				Shah to present the request for revision in completion date of 
				Tier III Data Centre at IBA City Campus.<br>
				<br>
				4.2 Mr. Waseem said that during the presentation made by Mr. 
				Maroof, CEO of AMFCO, the Executive Committee was informed that 
				the completion of data centre will take 170 days after the 
				signing of the contract. At that time the signing of the 
				contract was expected to be July 28, 2012 and the expected 
				project completion date was January 31, 2013. However, the 
				Executive Committee decided to conduct a value engineering 
				exercise to save the cost. The value engineering meant to 
				restart the search of products with comparable specifications 
				and features. This also necessitated to redo the contracts and 
				other documentations. They had to make new connections with the 
				different product vendors which took substantial time as they 
				had to evaluate these new products before submitting them to IBA 
				for approval. Ultimately the new contract was signed off on 
				September 26, 2012. He said that the new completion date by 
				adding 170 days comes out to be March 27, 2013. He assured that 
				they would try their best to meet the 170 days time limit. 
				However, he said that since they would be dealing with new 
				vendors and new products, the approval of these products by IBA 
				authorities might cause some delays in ordering these products 
				which may cause additional days in delivery of these products 
				and completion of the Data Centre. He requested the EC to 
				approve the revised completion date of March 27, 2013. He 
				confirmed that there is no cost escalation. <br>
				<br>
				4.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that H.K. Shah should have done the 
				work in parallel in good faith so that the time could have been 
				saved. He asked Mr. Waseem to prepare Critical Path Analysis 
				(CPA) and give it to Mr. Mansoor. Mr. Mansoor said that four 
				submittals which are minor in nature have not yet been received 
				from H.K. Shah. Mr. Waseem assured that they would send them in 
				the next three to four days. <br>
				<br>
				4.4 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to what are the common 
				elements in the data centres of the two campuses. He suggested 
				to design the data centre of the Main Campus in such a way that 
				essential parts are fully redundant and compliant with tier III 
				and the rest can be kept at Tier II. He said that security of 
				servers should be fully reliant because we want to provide 
				services to small banks which cannot afford to have their own 
				data centre. These prospective clients would be more concerned 
				about the security and confidentiality of the data.<br>
				<br>
				4.5 Mr. Imran Batada said that the Contractors’ understanding is 
				that the project cost will be paid to AMFCO and the taxes will 
				have to be paid by IBA. Mr. Moeid Sultan said that income tax 
				will be withheld according to contract. Mr. Waseem said that the 
				Contractor is referring to clause 4.1 of the contract according 
				to which IBA will bear all the taxes. The Dean &amp; Director said 
				that on imported items there are sales tax and central excise 
				duties and import duty but income tax is something which we are 
				bound to deduct and withhold. He said that income tax is a part 
				of the profit which the contractor has to pay and for other 
				taxes IBA has the exemption. The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. 
				Waseem to convince AMFCO that we want to be fair but we have to 
				follow legal obligations. <br>

				4.6 The Registrar said that servers and others equipments will 
				come in sealed units and for the Air-conditioners it is 
				pre-requisite that they be up. He wanted to know the date when 
				the AC will be on. He said that the size of the equipment should 
				be checked and ensured that it passes through the doors or 
				windows and if not then doors or windows can be enlarged. He 
				informed the Committee that on the third floor where computer 
				lab is located, the racks were to be placed but due to its size 
				it was taken in by breaking the window. Mr. Waseem said that the 
				Air-conditioner will be activated before March 2013. The 
				Registrar asked to fix the date. Mr. Waseem said that he would 
				inform the exact date.<br>
				<br>
				4.7 To a question from the Director Projects, whether 
				pre-shipment inspection of the equipment has been done, Mr. 
				Waseem said that it has not been done because of various 
				reasons; time and money being the main factors but he confirmed 
				that factory tested certificate for the equipments will be 
				obtained. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>

				27, 2013 of the data centre at the City Campus.<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				b) Outsourcing of vacant ICT positions.<br>
				<br>
				4.11 The Director ICT said that in the fiscal year 2013-14, due 
				to upcoming projects, ICT infrastructure, including labs, is 
				growing rapidly, resulting in an increase in manpower 
				requirement. Detail of the existing labs and the strength of ICT 
				Lab staff is as follows: <br>
				<br>
				Campus Location Assigned duty Shift Total Strength<br>
				Morning Evening <br>
				Main Aman CED Lab 1<br>

				Block Lab 16 Waqar Usman 2<br>
				FCS UGL Haider Adnan 2<br>
				Lab B-8 Arif Faisal 2<br>
				Total 8<br>
				<br>
				4.12 The Director ICT said that since the scope of services and 
				programs at IBA is expanding at a very fast pace, there is an 
				equally fast paced expansion in ICT services portfolio, with an 
				increase in number of ICT labs as well. Among new requirements, 
				a few would be immediately required, as mentioned below:<br>

				<br>
				4.13 The Director ICT said that it is necessary that ICT 
				department has the required number of people available to 
				provide optimum level of service and support to users. Since we 
				have clear instructions from the Dean &amp; Director that no more 
				staff shall be hired for ICT on IBA’s payroll, and vacant 
				positions should be filled through outsourcing, the only 
				solution is to acquire outsourced services through a vendor. He 
				said that M/s Inbox, who is currently providing us the help desk 
				services, is charging us @ Rs.20,828/- per month, per person. He 
				requested the Executive Committee to conceptually approve the 
				acquisition of services of 10 no of Support Persons, through 
				outsourcing, at an estimated total cost of Rs.2,520,000/- 
				(Rs.21,000/- x 10 x 12) per annum to fill in the vacant 
				positions, as directed by the Dean &amp; Director.<br>
				<br>
				4.14 The Dean &amp; Director said that we are just shifting from old 
				to new lab. He wanted to know as to why additional lab staff is 
				needed and what are the vacant positions. The Registrar said 
				that Tabba Building has got a new lab. Mr. Raza Abdi said that 
				there are four vacant positions. The Director H.R. said that 
				there are 11 approved positions, out of which three are vacant, 
				and one is needed for the new lab. So four positions are to be 
				filled. <br>
				<br>
				4.15 Dr. Sayeed Ghani said that an MS student is available who 
				can be engaged in the lab. Mr. Raza Abdi said that for hardware 
				lab engineering background is needed. <br>
				<br>
				4.16 The Dean &amp; Director said that the position should be 
				outsourced but the persons selected should be technically sound 
				and customer customer friendly. He said that to get quality 
				person we should request for a panel of three to interview and 
				select the best one. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				4.17 The Committee allowed to outsource four lab staff and one 
				lab engineer.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				c) To consider and approve Academic Calendar 2013-14.<br>
				<br>
				4.18 The Registrar said that he has presented the Academic 
				Calendar after discussing with the Controller of Examinations. 
				He said that cushions for strikes have been kept in the 
				calendar. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				4.19 The Committee approved the Academic Calendar 2013-14 and 
				advised the Registrar to make cushions for exams also and to 
				circulate it to all concerned for their comments. <br>
				<br>
				d) Nomination of Mr. Sharaf Husain, PhD Scholar, as Lab 
				Administrator.<br>
				<br>
				4.20 Dr. Sayeed Ghani suggested that as Mr. Raza Abdi was going 
				on leave, in his place Mr. Sharaf Husain, Ph.D Scholar be 
				nominated as Lab Administrator.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				4.21 The Dean &amp; Director agreed to the proposal of Dr. Sayeed 
				Ghani and instructed Mr. Sharaf Husain to ensure optimal 
				utilization of labs, supervision of lab staff, surprise checks, 
				their trainings on human as well as technical skills. He asked 
				him to pay attention to system, and SOP.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair. <br>
