</span>Ms. Faiza Izhar in her email stated that in response to her request for 
reimbursement of fee taken in advance in lieu of Summer 2009, Fall 2009 
semesters and the entire admission fee, she received the cheque of Rs.61,550/-

IBA, in such admission termination or null or void admissions IBA is liable to 
return entire admission fee to the candidate. She stated that the entire fee 
incurred totalled up to Rs.105,509/-, which in her opinion is not valid to be

to write a business plan of 10 marks in a group of 4 students. During assessment 
of term report the faculty member identified that many business plans were 
plagiarized (detected through computer package VIPER and Plagiarismdetect). 
After the matter was reported to Dean and Director, a three member committee 
(Dr. Wasim A. Khan, Dr. Qazi Massod, and Dr. Hemen Das Lohano) was formulated to 
assess the whole plagiarizing issue. The committee sent their report to Mr.

Committee decided to lower the total cut off point so that the required number 
of students are available. He clarified that although the total cut off was 
lowered, individual cut off points remained unchanged. He also suggested that 
Merit Scholarship to top six students be given. He informed the Committee that 
because of BS, they cannot prepare waiting list for BBA He said that the 80% and

presentation made by M/s. Icon on the proposed structural Master Plan of IBA. He 
said that from the presentation his feeling was that as if we are going to 
destroy the structural history of IBA and on its ruins are trying to build 
structures that might be ten times more grand than the existing one. He wondered 
as to where will be that IBA which was constructed in 1965 as the oldest 
business school outside the North America. Where will be those class room 
blocks, corridors, libraries, auditoriums, that magnificent sprawling lawn (main 
campus) that witnessed the training of best business managers who proved their 
worth in the top national and multinational business firms ever since 1958? &nbsp;All 
these will be gone forever according to the proposed master plan and will become 
part of reminiscence.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB">8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mobin Khalili accepted that we are far behind 
in infrastructure and related facilities. But he said that standard norm world 
over is to preserve the structural history as heritage and add on new structural 
facilities that blend with the old buildings. He asked if it would not have been 
better if we had done the same; preserving the historical buildings by 
renovating it and constructing new buildings symmetrically blending with the old 
ones. He requested for a rethinking on adopting the new construction plan for 
protecting our more than half a century physical presence.</span></p>

</span>The Director said that in principle he agrees with Mr. Mobin Khalili and 
has the same feelings as those of Mr. Khalili and he also believes in the 
heritage building but he said that there is a shortage of space and he has no 
choice.&nbsp; He said that if IBA could get the Income Tax Building adjacent to the 
City Campus, it would have been possible to preserve the existing buildings.&nbsp;
