			<br>
			Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects, attended the meeting on 
			special invitation.<br>
			<br>
			The following items were discussed: <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.1 To consider and approve the award of work to the lowest 
			bidder for supply and installation of Sewage Treatment Plant.</b><br>
			<br>
			1.1 The Director Projects reported that an advertisement was floated 
			in May 2012 in order to pre-qualify the specialty contractors for 
			the sewage treatment plant. After detail scrutiny and approval of 
			IBA authorities the following contractors were pre-qualified and 
			tenders for supply and installation of Sewage treatment plant were 
			floated to the following contractors:<br>
			<br>
			1. M/s Eco West International (Pvt.) Ltd.<br>
			2. M/s Samad Khan Babar &amp; Co &amp; So-Safe Water Technology<br>
			3. M/S PEPAK-KG(JV)<br>
			4. M/s RM Gulistan Engineer &amp; Contractor<br>
			5. M/s KSB Pumps Co. Ltd.<br>
			<br>
			1.2 All the five contractors collected the bid and except M/s Eco 
			West International all submitted the bids on specified date and 
			time. The bids were opened in front of Contractor’s representatives, 
			Architect’s representative, Project Manager’s representative and IBA 
			officials. The bids announced at the time of bidding after rebate 
			given by the contractors were as follows:<br>
			<br>
			1. M/s. Samad Khan Babar &amp; Co. &amp; So-Safe Water Technology 
			Rs.28,830,820<br>
			2. M/s. PEPAK-KG(JV) Rs.30,210,637 <br>
			3. M/s. RM Gulistan Engineers &amp; Contractor Rs.19,966,182<br>
			4. M/s. KSB Pumps Rs.29,750,000<br>
			<br>
			1.3 The Director Projects informed the Committee that the bids 
			documents as received from the contractors were sent to M/s. NESPAK 
			and M/s. NBCL for their scrutiny and evaluation on October 11, 2012. 
			M/s NESPAK and M/s NBCL submitted their reports on November 26, 
			2012. In their reports M/s. NESPAK and M/s. NBCL both recommended 
			the award of work to M/s. RM Gulistan Engineers &amp; Contractors at a 
			cost of Rs.20,866,109/- The Director Projects clarified that as per 
			the Evaluation Report of M/s. NBCL the final price of the lowest 
			bidder is Rs.20,508,005/- In their report they wrongly adjusted the 
			O&amp;M cost therefore there is a difference of Rs.358,104/- between 
			NESPAK and NBCL reports. He said that they have taken the price of 
			the lowest bidder from NESPAK’s report which is Rs.20,866,109/-.<br>
			<br>
			1.4 The Director Projects reported that the case was presented in 
			Technical Evaluation Committee and the Central Purchase Committee 
			meetings held on Saturday December 08, 2012 and Thursday, December 
			20, 2012 respectively. Both the TEC and the CPC recommended the 
			approval for award of work to the lowest evaluated bidder.<br>
			<br>
			1.5 Based on the recommendations of Architect, Project Managers, 
			Technical Evaluation Committee and Central Purchase Committee, the 
			Director Projects requested the Executive Committee to approve of 
			award of work to the lowest Evaluated bidder M/s. RM Gulistan 
			Engineers &amp; Contractors at a cost of Rs.20,866,109/- for the supply 
			and installation of Sewage treatment plant at IBA Main Campus.<br>
			<br>
			1.6 Dr. Nishat observed that the bid prices of three contractors are 
			almost consistent but the bid price of M/s. RM Gulistan Engineers &amp; 
			Contractors is almost 50% low. The Director Projects said that M/s. 
			KSB Pumps have quoted Rs.5 million more than the estimate for the 
			Pump. Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that the KSB Pumps’ STP is a compact 
			unit and its quality is better. Mr. Mobin Khalili said that there 
			should be a comparison of the items and price quoted by the 
			contractors so that the EC may know the difference of price and 
			quality. The Dean &amp; Director said that because of low price the 
			equipment should not be of inferior quality which may give trouble 
			at a later stage. The Director Projects said that more than the 
			quality of equipment, it requires proper maintenance. He said that 
			similar pump at Sindh Club was closed probably due to 
			non-maintenance. <br>
			<br>
			1.7 Mr. Zafar Siddiqui said that if the TEC and CPC had done due 
			diligence then the questions raised in the EC would have been raised 
			and answered in TEC and CPC. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			1.8 The Committee deferred this item and requested the Director 
			Projects to invite NESPAK and SMC to satisfy the EC that there would 
			be no compromise on the quality of equipment and work if the 
			contract is awarded to the lowest bidder.<br>
			<br>
			ACTION<br>
			<br>
			1.9 The Director Projects would invite NESPAK and SMC to brief the 
			EC. The Director Projects would also obtain details as to why the 
			pump at Sindh Club was closed. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.2 To consider and approve the procurement of furniture 
			for New Girls' Hostel, Phase 1 – STHP.</b><br>
			<br>
			2.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that bids for the furniture for new 
			Girls’ Hostel (Phase 1 – STHP) for which the funds have been 
			provided by Government of Sindh, under the PC-1, were invited from 
			the following four pre-qualified manufacturers / suppliers:<br>
			<br>
			1. M/s. Inspire Interior<br>
			2. M/s. SIMAB (smc-pvt) Ltd.<br>
			3. M/s. Versant<br>
			4. M/s. Zunn Furniture (Pvt.) Ltd.<br>
			<br>
			2.2 He said that one of the aforesaid prospective bidders, namely, 
			M/s. Zunn Furniture (Pvt.) Ltd. declined to participate in the 
			bidding, through their e-mail of December 08, 2012 because the term 
			of payment was not acceptable to them. Rest of them submitted their 
			bids which were opened on December 17, 2012, in the presence of two 
			of the bidders’ representatives. He presented Comparative Statement 
			of the bids. The bid prices quoted by them were as follow:<br>
			<br>
			1. M/s. Inspire Interior : Rs. 6,494,000<br>
			2. M/s. SIMAB (smc-pvt.) Ltd. : 6,229,437<br>
			3. M/s. Versant : 11,579,584<br>
			<br>
			2.3 Mr. Shameem informed the Committee that TEC considered this 
			proposal in its meeting held on December 19, 2012 and recommended 
			that the contract be awarded to the lowest bidder, namely, SIMAB (smc-pvt.) 
			Ltd. at the bid price of Rs.6,229,437/- He said that the proposal 
			has also been considered and recommended by CPC that the contract 
			for the furniture be awarded to the lowest bidder.<br>
			<br>
			2.4 The Dean &amp; Director said that we have acquired furniture for 
			boys’ and girls’ hostels in earlier periods. He said that there 
			should be a comparison of the cost of furniture procured earlier and 
			the price quoted this time. Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that the 
			specifications for the furniture for boys’ hotel were different so 
			the cost was also high. He said that he has repeated the 
			specifications of the furniture of old girls’ hostel and the price 
			is almost the same.<br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			2.5 The Committee approved the procurement of furniture for new 
			Girls’ Hostel (Phase 1 –STHP) from the lowest bidder namely M/s. 
			SIMAB (smc-pvt.) Ltd. at the bid price of Rs.6,229,437/- <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.3 To consider and approve the additional fee to M/s. KP &amp; 
			Associates for re-designing, re-engineering &amp; designing and 
			supervision for temporary electrical supply for Aman-CED Building<br>
			</b><br>
			3.1 The Director Projects said that M/s. KP &amp; Associates were 
			requested to provide IBA value engineering of their design based on 
			which the cost of the work as per the lowest bid was received for 
			Rs.147 million. At the same time they had to re-design the entire 
			system due to change in the mode of supply from KESC. This involved 
			complete revision of the Electrical Infrastructure drawings. They 
			were also requested to provide their design for the temporary 
			electric supply for Aman-CED and New Academic Block. He said that 
			since all these work fall in purview of additional work, KP 
			Associates were asked to submit their fee based on actual man-hour 
			in preparing the design and supervision. Accordingly, they claimed 
			fixed fee of Rs.400,000/- However, when they were requested to 
			reduce the amount, they reduced the amount by 10%. The Director 
			Projects requested the EC to approve payment of Rs.360,000/- to M/s. 
			KP Associates as the work done by them was to meet emergent timeline 
			without which the power supply to Aman-CED and New Academic Block 
			would have not been possible.<br>
			<br>
			3.2 The Dean &amp; Director said that M/s KP Associates have been very 
			cooperative and they did the additional work at our request and they 
			came up with temporary solution for the Aman-CED building to make it 
			functional and save lot of costs on diesel for the generator that 
			would have otherwise been used. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			3.3 The Committee approved the additional fee of Rs.360,000/- to 
			M/s. KP &amp; Associates for re-designing, re-engineering &amp; designing 
			and supervision for temporary electrical supply for Aman-CED 
			Building.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.4 Request from Mr. Shahid Ilyas, a student of EMBA for 
			Make-up Examination</b><br>
			<br>
			4.1 Mr. Shahid Ilyas, student of EMBA, through his email to the 
			Controller of Examinations, reported that he could not appear for 
			SHRM paper held on Friday, December 14, 2012 from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. 
			as he was stuck in a huge traffic jam around IBA City Campus. He had 
			reported that he was coming from SITE and tried to reach IBA from 
			three different routes but couldn't get there. He was finally stuck 
			up at road from Lasbela to Zoo and was stranded there till 10:30 
			p.m. (at this time the situation of city also turned bad). He 
			reported that he reached home at 11:00 p.m. He also mentioned in his 
			email that Mr. Arshad Zia had called him at 8:16 p.m. and offered 
			him to come even late for the paper, but he (Shahid) did not have a 
			chance to get his car through and park somewhere like petrol pump. 
			Mr. Shahid requested to consider this as a special case and allow 
			him for the Re-paper in due course so that his grades do not 
			deteriorate.<br>
			<br>
			4.2 Mr. Mobin Khalili said that since it was the final exam, as per 
			rule, make-up is not allowed. However, he said that Mr. Shahid Ilyas 
			may be given an ‘I’ in that course. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			4.3 The Committee decided to give ‘I’ (Incomplete) to Mr. Shahid 
			Ilyas on SHRM (Strategic Human Resource Management).<br>
			<br>
			<b>Item No.5 Up-date on Time Bound Projects from the Director ICT.</b><br>

			<b>Item No.6 Request from Ms. Maria Ali, student of BBA 7 for 
			make-up examination.</b><br>
			<br>
			6.1 Ms. Maria Ali, student of BBA-7 in her email to Dr. Nishat 
			reported that she was unable to appear for her Consumer Behavior 
			hourly as she was hospitalized on October 12, 2012 on account of 
			severe illness. She had attached medical certificate in support of 
			her application. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			6.2 The Committee allowed make-up exam to Ms. Maria Ali, student of

			missed due to hospitalization.<br>

			<br>
			7.1 Mr. Zafar Siddiqui said that he has got two videos; one on 
			Corporate officials, and another about students at IBA, prepared 
			through IBA students. The members were then shown the two videos.
			<br>
			<br>
			7.2 The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Zafar Siddiqui to reduce his 
			(D&amp;D’s) videos. Other members of the EC made the following 
			observations:<br>
			<br>
			Video for Corporate Officials<br>
			<br>
			o The speed of the video was very high.<br>
			o Video was a bit blurred <br>
			o Some security arrangements should be highlighted. <br>
			o Students Projects on Computer Science, artificial intelligence, 
			robotics, for example, should be included.<br>
			<br>
			Video on students at IBA<br>
			<br>
			o Societies’ activities should be covered<br>
			o Hostel facilities should be shown<br>
			o Coverage be given to students coming through NTHP – their rural 
			background, stay and study at IBA, and their placement.<br>
			<br>
			7.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that instead of security arrangement, 
			it should be mentioned that despite law and order problems in 
			Karachi IBA remains open; classes and exams are held on time and 
			degrees are awarded on time. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			7.4 The Committee requested Mr. Zafar Siddiqui to incorporate the 
			observations / suggestions noted in 7.2 and 7.3 above. <br>
			<br>
			b) Kitchen at Students’ Centre.<br>
			<br>
			7.5 The Director Projects said that he was not present in the last 
			EC meeting where it was reported that 35 ampere electrical load for 
			each outlet would be required. He said that according to the 
			Consultant, 35 ampere would be insufficient. He further said that 
			the existing gas pressure will not be sufficient; it will have to be 
			increased but it may take time. Till such time the gas from SSGC is 
			available, gas cylinder will have to be arranged. <br>
			<br>
			DECISION<br>
			<br>
			7.6 The Dean &amp; Director said that if 35 ampere electrical load is 
			insufficient, then it may be increased. He asked the Director 
			Projects to talk to SSGC for the increased pressure of gas. He 
			further said that if the Director Projects does not succeed then he 
			would talk to the MD, SSGC. The Director ICT said that he would get 
			this issue resolved. The Dean &amp; Director requested the Director ICT 
			to arrange a meeting of the Director Projects with the MD, SSGC. <br>
			<br>
			There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a vote 
			of thanks to the Chair. <br>
