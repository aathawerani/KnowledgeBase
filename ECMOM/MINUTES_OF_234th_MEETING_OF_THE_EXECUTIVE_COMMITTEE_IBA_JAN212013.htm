				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 1 To consider and approve proposal for CCTV Cameras 
				for IBA Boys Hostel. </b><br>
				<br>
				1.1 Major (R) Qamar Abbas, Security Coordinator presented the 
				proposal for procurement of Electronic (CCTV) Surveillance 
				System at Boys’ Hostel of IBA. He said that a total of sixteen 
				cameras would be installed at the Boys’ Hostel. <br>
				<br>
				1.2 The Dean &amp; Director said that sixteen cameras have been 
				installed at the Main Campus. He wanted to know as to why 
				similar number is required for Boys’ Hostel. The Registrar 
				clarified that they would use room specific cameras at the Boys’ 
				Hostel.<br>
				<br>
				1.3 The Director HR showed her concern over the growing stealing 
				problem over there. The Director ICT wanted to know if there is 
				a dedicated person on surveillance for 24 hours. The Security 
				Coordinator replied in the negative. <br>
				<br>
				1.4 The Director Projects inquired about response procedures &amp; 
				reaction time of security guards in case some unusual movement 
				is observed by CCTV operator. It was suggested that an SOP be 
				developed on method of raising alarm and responding to activity 
				detected by the CCTV cameras.<br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Dean &amp; Director emphasized on the need to economize on 
				human resources, deploy them judicially and ensure that the 
				information gathered by the systems installed at different 
				locations should be capable of being viewed at a central hub.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				1.6 The Executive Committee appreciated the performance / 
				effective utilization of existing Electronic (CCTV) Surveillance 
				System.<br>
				<br>
				1.7 The Executive Committee in principle approved the 
				procurement and installation of Electronic (CCTV) Surveillance 
				System for IBA Boys’ Hostel.<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				1.8 The Registrar would review the requirements of cameras and 
				reduce the total number of cameras to 12 instead of 16. 
				Procurement of the system would take place as proposed by 
				security coordinator in his presentation as per IBA purchase and 
				procurements procedures in vogue.<br>
				<br>
				1.9 The Security Coordinator in consultation with the Registrar 
				would develop a SOP on method of raising alarm and responding to 
				activity detected by the CCTV cameras.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 To consider and approve the implementation of the 
				Synchronization Scheme. </b><br>
				<br>
				2.1 The Director Projects informed the Committee that about 
				three weeks ago it was observed by him that the work on the LV 
				Room at City Campus was left incomplete by M/s. Siemens because 
				of a deficiency in the design done by M/s. EA Consulting. This 
				was confirmed by Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects and 
				Incharge of KESC Sub-station and re-location of gen-sets at City 
				Campus as well as by Mr. Jawad Khan, Electrical Engineer. He 
				further informed that he had advised Mr. Jawad Khan to undertake 
				the completion of work on emergency basis so that power be made 
				available to FCS Building which was near completion. He said 
				that at the same time he requested Maintenance Manager Mr. 
				Mushtaq Ahmad to prepare and present the case to the Executive 
				Committee for approval of the emergency work after taking 
				quotations from the Electrical Contractors working at the City 
				Campus with the assistance of Mr. Jawad Khan. <br>
				<br>
				2.2 Mr. Jawad Khan, Electrical Engineer and Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed, 
				Maintenance Manager presented the technical details of the case 
				which is summarized below:<br>
				<br>
				• Mr. Jawad Khan informed that he had pointed out this 
				deficiency in the start of the project to Mr. Shameem Ahmed. He 
				said that after continuous follow up the Consultant admitted his 
				mistake. Accordingly new system design was prepared by him and 
				was forwarded for implementation.<br>
				<br>
				• Nothing happened in spite of continuous follow up. Now LV 
				distribution system is not energized as yet. Old system is 
				providing the services. New system is to be energized after the 
				completion of the balanced work. Scope of services was briefly 
				presented to the EC by Mr. Jawad.<br>
				<br>
				2.3 Mr. Jawad Khan further informed that the balance work 
				consists of provision for the additional outlets for the load 
				supply. For this the following three options were considered:<br>
				<br>
				Option # 1: Modification of the existing panels and shifting of 
				old cables to the new panel.<br>
				<br>
				Option # 2: A new panel containing the required breakers to be 
				placed at suitable place and hooked up with the existing system 
				and shifting of old cables to the new panel.<br>
				<br>
				Option # 3: To dismantle the existing panel and make a new panel 
				altogether and shifting of old cables to the new panel. <br>
				<br>
				2.4 Mr. Jawad Khan reported that after detailed deliberations, 
				it was agreed that Option # 2 was the best option keeping in 
				view the time factor, convenience and integrity of the existing 
				system. For this purpose emergency quotations were obtained with 
				the assistance of the Projects Departments from the contractors 
				already working on IBA Projects. Some parameters like timeframe 
				needed to be confirmed from contractors. He also said that the 
				cost difference, between the quotations and if the normal 
				procedure was followed, was minor.<br>
				<br>
				2.5 Mr. Jawad said that the estimated cost based on the project 
				contractors’ quotation is around Rs.1.8 million. He requested 
				the Executive Committee to approve in principle the cost 
				estimate. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				2.6 The Executive Committee approved in principle the cost 
				estimate of Rs.1.8 for Option # 2 as stated above.<br>
				<br>
				2.7 The Committee further decided that the work would be on 
				permanent basis, without any changes in the future. However, 
				arrangement must be made on temporary basis for supply of Power 
				to classes in FCS Block by keeping off the air conditioning of 
				the FCS Block. This AC supply is to be shifted to new panel thus 
				making possible operation of the essential section of new 
				electrical system of FCS Extension Projects.<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				2.8 Mr. Jawad Khan would proceed with the case as per the laid 
				down procedures.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 3 To consider an application and medical certificate 
				from Ms. Asawera Khan a <br>
				Student of BBA-III for make-up exam” </b><br>
				<br>
				3.1 Ms. Asawera Khan, a student of BBA-III in her application 
				reported that she missed the second hourly exam of 
				Socio-philosophy of Islam and Statistical Inference on November 
				29 and 30, 2012 as she had had a severe attack of chest 
				infection and acute asthma and was under observation at Liaquat 
				National Hospital overnight and was recommended two days of 
				complete bed rest. She requested for the make-up examination for 
				the two courses that she missed.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Registrar said that he checked it with the LNH and the 
				LNH in writing have confirmed that Ms. Asawera Khan was 
				presented in Accident &amp; Emergency Department of LNH on November 
				29, 2012 with complaint of shortness of breath, and was 
				diagnosed as a case of acute exacerbation of asthma. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Committee allowed make-up examinations to Ms. Asawera 
				Khan for Socio-Philosophy of Islam, and Statistical Inference 
				that she missed in the second hourlies.<br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				3.4 The Registrar would convey the decision of the EC to Ms. 
				Asawera Khan.<br>
				<br>
				3.5 The Controller of Examinations would arrange make-up 
				examinations for the above two courses for Ms. Asawera Khan.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair. <br>
