				<br>
				1.1 Ms. Maheen Ghauri said that in the last EC meeting it was 
				decided to give some time to the EC members so that they may 
				thoroughly go through the proposal and give their comments. 
				However, she reported that no comments were received from the EC 
				members. She said that she has included the revised rate of 
				remuneration for faculty in the proposal (in the previous EC 
				meeting up-dated rate of remuneration was not presented). <br>
				<br>
				1.2 The Registrar said that last year the Dean &amp; Director had 
				emphasized that the Summer Program should be properly marketed. 
				Accordingly, they had prepared advertisement for that. Ms. 
				Maheen said that they have spent a lot of time on marketing. The 
				Dean &amp; Director asked the Registrar to send the material on 
				Summer School Program to student counsellers of various schools.
				<br>
				<br>
				1.3 It was proposed by a member that IBA should offer test 
				preparation program in summer school. However, the Dean &amp; 
				Director did not agree to it.<br>
				<br>

				2013 as presented by Ms. Maheen Ghouri incorporating the 
				suggestions noted above as well as those noted in the previous 
				meeting of the EC. <br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>

				1.6 The Registrar would send the material including posters on 
				IBA Summer School Program 2013 to various schools offering 
				Matric/Intermediate, and ‘O’ &amp; ‘A’ Levels programs. <br>

				<br>
				Total Over Run (a + c) : Rs. 14,730,600<br>
				<br>
				Net Impact (Total Over Run –Saving) : Rs. 8,213,272<br>
				<br>
				2.2 The Director Projects said that the variations in the cost 
				were already approved by AMAN-IBA Project Committee in their 
				6th, 7th, 8th and 11th meetings details of the approved 
				variations are as under:<br>

				<br>
				2.3 The Director Projects said that the costs of variations were 
				adjusted by substituting and reducing the cost of original BOQ. 
				However an over run of Rs.8,213,272/- occurred which is 3% of 
				total cost of the Project. The Director Projects requested the 
				Executive Committee to approve the additional amount of 
				Rs.8,213,272/- so that the project can be closed financially.<br>
				<br>
				2.4 The Director Finance emphasized to consider IBA funding to 
				procure those project cost components where IBA procurement 
				rules were followed. <br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Director Projects confirmed that they have followed the 
				SPPRA rules in the procurement of furniture. However the 
				Interior Decoration works package was awarded to the existing 
				civil contractor after the approval of the Aman –IBA Project 
				Committee while the procurement of Generator was the part of the 
				BOQ of the Electrical Contractor.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.6 The Committee approved the additional amount of 
				Rs.8,213,272/- other than the Aman Foundation funding for the 
				Aman-CED Building.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 3 To Consider and Approve the Case of M/s ZCL the 
				contracts of Administration Building City Campus to the legal 
				advisor IBA, for legal advice.</b><br>
				<br>
				3.1 The Director Projects reported that the contractors M/s ZCL 
				have refused to accept the presence of project managers on the 
				project at the stage of checking of final bill whereas he had 
				completed the project under the supervision and discretion of 
				the project managers. He said that IBA cannot make payment to 
				M/s ZCL until they fulfil the requirement of final bill 
				acceptance by the project managers. <br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Dean &amp; Director said that the Director Projects should 
				exercise his right and write a letter to the Contractor as a 
				client to rectify those deficiencies with which the Projects 
				Department is not satisfied and if they do not respond 
				positively then they can be asked to have a meeting with the 
				Dean &amp; Director IBA.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Committee agreed with the Dean &amp; Director that the 
				Director Projects should write a letter to the contractor to 
				rectify those works with which they are not satisfied. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Item No. 4 To consider the observations of the Executive 
				Committee and comments received from Architects on Students’ 
				Centre.<br>
				<br>
				4.1 The Director Projects reported that the following 
				observations were noted during the visit of Executive Committee 
				members on February 4, 2013, which were conveyed to the 
				Architect M/s. NBCL and they have given their comments which are 
				noted against each of the observations:<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 1 Design of donor’s wall is to be provided by 
				Architect.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 2 Door and electric switches on donor’s wall 
				shall be shifted on other side.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: Only switches were to be shifted on the other side of the 
				wall. However, please note that after reviewing the furniture 
				layout, it was decided jointly by the Registrar and the 
				Architect that the door location will remain same.<br>
				<br>
				Mr. Zafar Siddiqui said that outside the entrance a wall can be 
				constructed because donors’ wall is always erected separately to 
				attract attention and give recognition. The Registrar said that 
				reception counter was on the front and donors wall was behind 
				the counter so he had suggested to shift the reception counter. 
				The Dean &amp; Director said that the donor wall is very important 
				and it should be prominent. He suggested that the reception 
				counter as well as the door should be moved from there. <br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 3 Two service windows are required in resource 
				room instead of one.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: Two open-able windows are not possible because of the 
				furniture layout. <br>
				<br>
				The Dean &amp; Director said that one window is enough because he 
				does not want more expenditure to be incurred.<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 4 Soft board is required on outer wall of 
				society offices.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 5 Record cabinets are required in society 
				office on both floors.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 6 Size of coffee shop’s counter is to be 
				reduced.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 7 Low height partition is to be provided on 
				hand wash area in dining room on ground floor.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 8 Provision of Multimedia with screen is to be 
				provided in event hall on first floor.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 9 Event hall first floor needs to be separated 
				with ground floor dining room to avoid noises from dining hall 
				during programs in event hall.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: OK<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 10 Separate entrance is to be provided for 
				gymnasium on 1st floor.<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: The layout and design was shown to the Executive Committee 
				and was approved by the EC. If the layout is changed, it will 
				have a drastic time and cost impact as the staircase is of RCC, 
				a structural member, and can’t be relocated or changed.<br>
				<br>
				The Director Projects said that it was suggested to separate 
				ladies and gents gymnasium but he said that it entails heavy 
				work and a lot of money. The Registrar said that he had 
				suggested to give lower floor to the boys and the first floor to 
				the girls and the entrance should be different. He said that it 
				is doable with very little money. The Dean &amp; Director asked the 
				Registrar to do that if it does not involve much work and money.
				<br>
				<br>
				EC Observation # 11 Registrar, IBA stressed for providing false 
				ceiling in Event Hall. However a Mockup with charcoal grey paint 
				on event hall ceiling shall be prepared for IBA review.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				NBCL: We will review the Mockup. However, regarding the false 
				ceiling in dining and event hall, it should be noted here that 
				the design was presented by NBCL and EC had approved it. Based 
				on the approval, all construction at site had been implemented 
				in that manner. In addition to that, all the light fixtures were 
				changed and now orders have already been placed.<br>
				<br>
				The Dean &amp; Director said that NBCL had given the presentation 
				and the EC had approved it. He said that we should not change 
				it.<br>
				<br>
				4.2 The Director Projects said that Dr. Sayeed Ghani had 
				suggested that the book shop at the Students’ Centre is small; 
				it should be bigger than this. The Director Projects said that 
				he would see if any big room can be arranged for the book shop. 
				The Dean &amp; Director agreed that book shop is more important than 
				students’ lounge. Students Lounge may be converted into book 
				shop and the small bookshop may be converted into lunge.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION<br>
				</b><br>
				4.3 The Committee noted and approved the comments / suggestions 
				noted above. <br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION<br>
				</b><br>
				4.4 The Director Projects would get the suggestions / decisions 
				of the EC noted above implemented. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 5 To consider and approve the appointment of a 
				consultant / consultant-cum-project manager for Faculty 
				Apartment at IBA Staff Town.</b><br>
				<br>
				5.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed reported that the Executive Committee in 
				its meeting held on 8th October 2012 had approved the design 
				layout for two types of faculty apartment that were prepared by 
				HEC-Projects department. The EC had also given a go ahead for 
				hiring of a consulting engineer cum project manager by inviting 
				technical and financial proposals from an existing list of 
				pre-qualified architectural and engineering consultants. The 
				list was provided by project department.<br>
				<br>
				5.2 Mr. Shameem said that the project scope is such that IBA 
				needs to hire the firm which can prepare the final design based 
				on the proposed preliminary design. This includes architectural 
				design, civil engineering, structural engineering, MEP design 
				and tender drawings and documents. With a view to improving the 
				proposed preliminary design, the prequalified consultants were 
				asked to submit their design based on the guidelines given in 
				the RFP.<br>
				<br>
				5.3 Mr. Shameem said that the technical proposals were opened in 
				the presence of the representatives of participating firms. 
				Total nine proposals were received. The technical proposals were 
				opened and thoroughly reviewed. The evaluation criteria have 
				been separated into two categories. The firms offering 
				architectural services only, namely NBCL and FNMH, were 
				evaluated separately. Whereas the firms with architectural and 
				project management facilities all under one roof have been 
				evaluated together. He said that depending on the decision of 
				EC, the consultants will be asked to make a final design 
				presentation. <br>
				<br>
				5.4 Mr. Shameem Ahmed reported that all nine applicants have 
				obtained 80% or more marks and are therefore recommended for 
				pre-qualification at this preliminary stage. He said that the 
				proposal was considered by TEC-PROJ in its meeting held on 
				February 8, 2013 and it recommended the preliminary evaluation 
				of the pre-qualification of consultant / consultants-cum-project 
				managers for the Faculty Apartments at IBA Staff Town to the 
				Central Purchase Committee. The CPC considered the matter in its 
				meeting and decided that in view of SPPRA Rule 66(7) the 
				Technical Proposal received from the two architects, namely, 
				NBCL and FNMH, cannot be entertained. The aforesaid rule 
				stipulates that evaluation of technical proposals should conform 
				to the criteria given in the RFP that allows only architectural 
				and engineering consultants-cum-project managers to submit their 
				technical and financial proposals; it excludes those who do not 
				have all facilities under one roof. The CPC therefore approved 
				the evaluation of technical proposals of only the 7 applicants.<br>
				<br>
				5.5 Mr. Shameem Ahmed requested the Executive Committee to 
				approve the CPC’s recommendation so that they may ask the seven 
				applicants to present their preliminary designs before the EC 
				and then they may open the financial proposals of those who get 
				higher marks after combining out of 20 marks to be given by the 
				EC to out of 80 marks. The Committee noted that 20 marks for the 
				design are too less and advised that logical division of 
				evaluation criteria and assigned marks should have been done.<br>
				<br>
				5.6 Mr. Shameem Ahmed requested the Executive Committee to 
				approve the CPC’s recommendation so that they may ask the seven 
				applicants to present their preliminary designs before the EC 
				and then they may open the financial proposals of those who get 
				higher marks after combining out of 20 marks to be given by the 
				EC to out of 80 marks.<br>
				<br>
				5.7 To a question as to who has evaluated the technical 
				proposal, Mr. Shameem Ahmed replied that it has been evaluated 
				by Ms. Sana Tanveer, Assistant Architect. The Dean &amp; Director 
				said that instead of single person’s evaluation, it should have 
				been evaluated by a committee as is done by the Projects 
				Department. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION </b><br>
				<br>
				5.8 The EC formed a committee of three comprising Engr. 
				Rehan-ul-Ambia Riaz, Mr. Javed Islam of HEC Projects, and Ms. 
				Sana Tanveer to evaluate the technical proposals including the 
				designs submitted by the competitors and recommend to the EC as 
				to who is number one, two or three in the ranking.<br>
				<br>
				Item No. 6 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.<br>
				<br>
				a) To consider and approve the Award of Furniture Works for the 
				Students’ Center at IBA Main Campus.<br>
				<br>
				6.1 The Director Projects reported that invitations for 
				collection of Tender documents for furniture works for the 
				Students’ Centre at IBA Main Campus were sent to the following 
				pre-qualified contractors:<br>
				<br>
				1. M/s Habib Sons<br>
				2. M/s Versant<br>
				3. M/s Simab<br>
				4. M/s Interwood<br>
				5. M/s Turnkey <br>
				<br>
				Out of the above five pre-qualified contractors, only three of 
				them collected the tender documents; M/s Interwood and M/s 
				Turnkey regretted. <br>
				<br>
				6.2 The Director Projects reported that procurement process of 
				Single stage two envelop was adopted for this work. The 
				technical bid was opened in front of Architect, IBA and 
				Contractors’ representatives. The Technical bids were then sent 
				to the Architect for their evaluation. The Architect sent their 
				report based on the evaluation criteria given in Tender 
				documents. As per their report all three bidders M/s Habib Sons, 
				M/s Versant and M/s Simab are technically qualified. He said 
				that the Technical Evaluation report was presented in TEC. The 
				TEC approved the opening of bids via circulation. In this 
				meeting The TEC recommended to open the bids of all qualified 
				bidders.<br>
				<br>
				6.3 The Financial bids were opened on the given date as 
				mentioned in bid opening statement in the presence of Project 
				Architect M/s NBCL, IBA and contractors’ representatives. The 
				following were the quoted prices announced at the time of bid 
				opening.<br>
				<br>
				1. M/s Versant Rs.8,116,700/- <br>
				2. M/s Habib Sons Rs.7,446,574/-<br>
				3. M/s SIMAB Rs.6,638,639/-<br>
				<br>
				6.4 The Director Projects reported that M/s SIMAB did not submit 
				the Earnest money bond therefore their bid was rejected as per 
				SPPRA rules. The Financial bids were then sent to Project 
				Architect for their Evaluation. The Project Architect submitted

				c) Kiosk at Tabba Building:<br>
				<br>
				6.12 The Director Projects presented the design of the Kiosk 
				prepared by NBCL as demanded by the Administration Department. 
				He said that the cost quoted by the present contractor is 
				Rs.295,000. He said that there are two options:<br>
				<br>
				1. The present contractor be assigned the work as variation 
				order.<br>
				2. The job be done through the open bidding to get a competitive 
				rates.<br>
				<br>
				6.13 The Director Projects said that the following practical 
				difficulties are being encountered at site:<br>
				<br>
				1. The existing planter will have to be broken<br>
				2. The job involves complete wet work<br>
				3. The contractor is not interested to do this job and is 
				claiming extra time in the existing contract. <br>
				4. The building is occupied and at this point in time 
				construction activity should not be allowed.<br>
				<br>
				6.14 The Director Projects suggested that: <br>
				<br>
				1. Design be reviewed and we should go for a simpler and 
				economical structure (preferably fiber glass)<br>
				2. Work of Kiosk be tendered as a separate work<br>
				3. Construction be undertaken during summer vacation.<br>
				<br>
				6.15 The Registrar said that the cost quoted by the present 
				contractor is very high. He said that there is no need to place 
				tender; he would manage it by himself by getting the planter 
				removed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				6.16 The Committee requested the Registrar to build the KIOSK as 
				he deems appropriate by keeping the cost at the minimum. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				d) Miscellaneous decisions. <br>
				<br>

				Centre we have got money from English Biscuit. He said that the 
				gymnasium would be named as Khawar Butt Gymnasium. He said that 
				for the gymnasium, project manager is not needed to be involved. 
				He asked the Registrar to give open tender for the equipment as 
				has been done for the Boys’ Hostel.<br>
				<br>
				6.18 The Dean &amp; Director said that the bookshop at the Students’ 
				Centre will be outsourced. He said that standard shelves will be 
				prepared for the bookshop. However, he asked the Director 
				Projects to consult with the Head Librarian for that. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a
