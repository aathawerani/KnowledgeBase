	reported that the New Boys Hostel has been substantially completed and its 
	ground floor (36 rooms), is being readied to accommodate new-coming students 
	by the end of the next week. However, he said that the power supply needed 
	for the hostel is an urgent issue. The electrical infrastructure proposed 
	for the hostel is at the tendering stage at the moment and will take about 5 
	months to complete. Until then we can depend upon power supply from the 
	Universitys KESC Sub-Station No.3, through the cable that was laid in 2010. 
	It runs upto the New Boys Hostels eastern boundary wall where a 400 Ampere 
	circuit breaker is already installed. He said that they have managed to have 
	this power supply switched on; an energy meter is, however, needed which 
	they would arrange.&nbsp; </span></p>

	of taking the power supply from the boundary wall to the electrical room in 
	the New Boys Hostel, for which an electrical cable, about 150 ft. in length 
	and 240mm<sup>2</sup>, is required urgently. Buying a new cable will cost 
	about Rs.2 million and the supplier will take about 3 to 5 weeks to deliver. 
	An alternative is to extract the cable that has become redundant and lay 
	buried underground at the City Campus. Its length is about 150 meters, part 
	of which can be utilized for the New Boys Hostel and the rest elsewhere in 
	the Main Campus. He reported that as this alternative appeared to be the 
	most feasible and economical they have obtained the following three 
	quotations for extraction/retrieval and transportation of the cable from 
	City Campus:</span></p>

	the southern side of the Academic Building, City Campus. In this regard, he 
	reported that first a meeting was held with the Architects of Aman Tower and 
	the Auditorium in order to modify the drawings. In this meeting various 
	options were considered but the Architects of Auditorium advised that any 
	modification in their design would reduce the number of seats by 40. 
	Secondly, the curvature of the ramp could not be changed which is serving 
	the basement from southern side. He said that because of the ground 
	conditions and that the Aman-Tower structure is already built up to ground 
	floor level, the only option available was to relocate the staircase tower.

	needed. Instead a spiral staircase will be installed in the corner which 
	will be sufficient. M/s. ICON further confirmed that this will not affect 
	the architectural aesthetics and functionality of the building. There will 
	be 6-8 feet passage available in between Academic Block and the Auditorium,
