				<font face="Verdana" size="2">
				<u><b>Item No. 1 To consider and approve the Maintenance Manual.</b></u><br>
				<br>
				1.1 The Registrar said that in order to facilitate maintenance 
				activities at IBA, Maintenance Department (headed by the 
				Registrar) has been bifurcated into two major divisions; (a) 
				Technical Maintenance, and (b) General Maintenance. Mr. 
				Mushtaque Ahmed is responsible for Technical Maintenance, while 
				Syed Faheemuddin is responsible for General Maintenance. He said 
				that Mr. Mushtaque will present the draft of the Technical 
				Maintenance Manual.<br>
				<br>
				1.2 Mr. Mushtaque said that the purpose of the Maintenance 
				Manual for Technical Division is to provide an update of 
				acceptable and effective maintenance and operations management 
				“best” practices and current standards for IBA facilities. It is 
				intended to provide a comprehensive framework for delivering 
				beneficial and cost effective services at each Campus of IBA. 
				The procedures manual will provide IBA Facilities Maintenance 
				Staff with a set of clearly defined, yet flexible guidelines 
				that are intended to complement sound facilities management 
				practices already in use and offer new ones where necessary. He 
				said that the proposed maintenance manual is just a guideline 
				and shall be modified with times adherent with the requirements.

				taken in emergency including procurement of parts and 
				equipments. But by following the set procedure, the work may be 
				delayed. The Dean &amp; Director said that the Manager Technical 
				Maintenance will have delegated powers to exercise in emergency 
				under the Transaction Authority Manual. He asked Mr. Mushtaque 
				to do forecasting and by following the laid down procedure 
				procure the equipment that may be replaced during the year. He 
				said that for unanticipated break down the Manager Technical 
				Maintenance will have the emergency power. <br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Dean &amp; Director suggested to do matching of the scope of 
				Technical Maintenance Division with the organizational chart. He 
				said that the responsibility for in-house nd outsourcing should 
				be clearly defined. The Director Projects suggested to include 
				STP (Sewage Treatment Plan) in the scope of work. <br>
				<br>
				1.6 Dr. Sayeed Ghani suggested that there should be a user 
				committee that may give regular feedback. The Dean &amp; Director 
				said that we get survey conducted by AC Nielsen and there are 
				help desks at both the campuses. He asked Mr. Mushtaque to 
				disseminate the contact numbers of help desks and other relevant 
				information. <br>
				<br>
				1.7 The Registrar asked Mr. Mushtaque to name the department 
				which would be responsible for procurement of material along 
				with the procedure in the Technical Maintenance Work Plan. The 
				Dean &amp; Director said that the department responsible for fire 
				protection should be mentioned and the concerned staff should be 
				trained. He asked the Registrar to invite Civil Defense people 
				to inspect our facilities and tell us what else is needed for 
				fire prevention and fire fighting at both the Campuses, the 
				hostel and the staff colony. He said that the person responsible 
				for Public Address System at the auditorium should also be 
				identified given proper instructions.<br>

				<u><b>Item No. 3 To consider and approve the cost estimates of

				3.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed said that the EC in its meeting held on 
				December 18, 2012 while considering the cost estimates of new 
				Boys’ Hostel’s External Development and some miscellaneous works 
				directed that the proposal be re-submitted incorporating the 
				suggestions given by the EC. He said that a revised proposal and 
				estimated cost in respect of external development and renovation 
				of boundary wall is not yet ready as the designs have not yet 
				been received from NBCL. Therefore the revised proposal will be 
				submitted to EC later. He requested the EC that for the time 
				being, it may approve the cost estimates of the following small 
				miscellaneous works only<br>
				<br>
				A) Septic Tanks + Soakage Pits at new Boys’ Hostel, : 
				Rs.4,675,290<br>

				both facilities ready also by May/June, 2013. He said that the

				contractor. <br>
				<br>
				3.4 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know if septic tank experts 
				are there among the pre-qualified contractors. Mr. Shameem Ahmed 
				replied that since it is not a highly technical job, the 
				prequalified contractors would be able to do it. <br>
				<br>
				3.5 Mr. Moeid Sultan said that there is a provision of Rs.1 
				million only in the budget for this job so they will have to 
				re-appropriate it. The Director Projects said that Rs.5 million

				for this purpose. He suggested that new Girls’ Hostel and

				<br>
				3.6 The Committee approved the cost estimate of Rs.5.87 million 
				for the miscellaneous jobs noted in 3.1 above. <br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>

				expenditure on Boys’ Hostel external development and inform the 
				EC. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No. 4 Any other item with the permission of the 
				Chair.</b></u><br>
				<br>
				<b>a) Up-dated cost of Electrical Infrastructure at IBA Main 
				Campus. </b><br>
				<br>
				4.1 The Director Projects said that in its 227th Meeting held on 
				26th November 2012, the Consultants of Electrical Infrastructure 
				Development at Main Campus, M/s. KP &amp; Associates presented the 
				following cost scenario pertaining to cost of cables based on 
				their final design:<br>
				<br>
				Previous Cost of cables Rs.23,231,295/- <br>
				Revised Cost of Cables Rs.22,827,790/- <br>
				Decreased in cost of Cables Rs. 403,505/- <br>
				<br>
				Thus the overall reduction in the cost could be as under:<br>
				<br>
				Previous Total Cost of Works Rs.123,344,906/- <br>
				Revised Total Cost of Works Rs.122,931,401/- <br>
				<br>
				4.2 The Director Projects said that Mr. Khalid Pervez had 
				further said that if IBA gets 22% discount on cables, the 
				revised total cost of work would be Rs.117,909,287/-. The 
				Committee had noted and approved the Revised Total Cost of Works 
				at Rs.122,931,401/- with a provision of further reduction to 
				Rs.117, 909,287/- after discount on cables to be obtained from 
				Pakistan Cables.<br>
				<br>
				4.3 The Director Projects reported that subsequently they 
				approached Pakistan Cables for giving the rebate to IBA, to 
				which they explained that they offer rebate up to 22% only on 
				the small size wires and not the large size cables. In this 
				regard meetings were held with Mr. Fahd Chiony and 
				communications were also exchanged by IBA as well as KPA. As a 
				result they offered a rebate of 4% and then another 2% on 
				further negotiations. Based on 6% rebate cable cost came upto 
				Rs.16,650,061/- (excluding contractor’s O.H. &amp; GST). <br>
				<br>
				4.4 The Director Projects said that they obtained prices of the 
				same cables from their competitors M/s. Newage who submitted the 
				cost as Rs.15,978,553/-. When Pak Cables were again approached, 
				they agreed to match the Newage cost as such the cost of cable 
				came as Rs.20,324,718/- after additions of overhead and profit 
				of 20% and 6% GST. He said that the difference of the cost of 
				cables as estimated by M/s. KP &amp; Associates and as offered by 
				Pak Cables came as follows:<br>
				<br>
				Rs.22,827,790/- (KPA) including OH, Profit and GST<br>
				Rs.20,324,718/- (based on discounted price of Pakistan Cables<br>
				Including OH, Profit and GST<br>
				Rs. 2,503,072/- Difference<br>
				<br>
				Based on above the contract cost shall be as follows:<br>
				<br>
				Rs. 122,931,401/- (KPA)<br>
				Rs. 2,503,072/- discount from cable costs as above <br>
				Rs. 120,428,329/- <br>
				<br>
				4.5 The Director Projects in conclusion reported that the above 
				cost of contract is based on 11% discount and not 22% as 
				anticipated. He requested the Dean &amp; Director to talk to Mr. 
				Chinoy for further discount.<br>
				<br>
				4.6 The Dean &amp; Director said that when such items are presented, 
				there should also be presented along with this a running picture 
				of the budget (what was allocated in the budget, what has been 
				spent, and what is left). <br>
				<br>
				4.7 The Dean &amp; Director said that he would talk to Mr. Fahad 
				Chinoy for further discount.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				4.8 The Committee noted and approved the up-date.<br>
				<br>
				There being no other issues, the meeting was concluded with a 
				vote of thanks to the Chair. <br>
