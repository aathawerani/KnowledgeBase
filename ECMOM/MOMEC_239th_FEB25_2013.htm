								Mr. Shameem Ahmed, Director HEC Projects, Dr. Nasir Afghan, Program Director MBA, Dr. Nasir Touheed, Coordinator Testing Services, Mr. Muhammad Saleem Umer, Program Director EMBA and Mr. Adnan Hameed, H.R. Manager attended the meeting on special invitation.<br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No. 1 To consider and approve Procurement of 
				Furniture for the Visiting Faculty Hostel.</b></u><br>
				<br>
				1.1 Mr. Shameem Ahmed reported that through their letter of 
				November 28, 2012, tenders were invited from the following four 
				pre-qualified furniture manufacturers:<br>
				<br>
				1. Zunn Furniture<br>
				2. Inspire Interior <br>
				3. Versant<br>
				4. SIMAB (smc-pvt) Ltd.<br>
				<br>
				1.2 He said that though all four had obtained the tender 
				documents, only the following two participated in the bidding. 
				The prices quoted by them are mentioned against their names:<br>
				<br>
				(a) Inspire Interiors : Rs. 4,149,000/-.<br>
				(b) SIMAB (smc-pvt.) Ltd. : Rs. 6,085,215/-<br>
				<br>
				1.3 Mr. Shameem Ahmed presented a copy of the Comparative 
				Statement, prepared on the date of opening.<br>
				<br>
				1.4 As M/s. Inspire Interiors are the lowest of the two, Mr. 
				Shameem Ahmed requested the EC to allow placing an order to M/s. 
				Inspire Interiors, at the bid price of Rs.4,149,000/- He 
				reported that the TEC and the CPC have recommended to the lowest 
				bidder M/s. Inspire Interiors.<br>
				<br>
				1.5 The Director Projects wanted to know as to what was the 
				engineers estimate. Mr. Shameem Ahmed replied that there was no 
				such estimate. The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know about the 
				quality of work of Inspire Interiors to which Mr. Shameem Ahmed 
				explained his satisfaction. The Dean &amp; Director asked the 
				Registrar to visit the factory of Inspire Interiors and verify 
				the quality of work independently. <br>
				<br>
				1.6 Mr. Zafar Siddiqui wanted to know as to why those who have 
				worked with IBA such as Habib &amp; Sons have not applied again. The 
				Director Projects replied that Habib &amp; Sons has applied for 
				Students’ Centre. The Dean &amp; Director said that Mr. Shameem 
				should have clubbed the requirements of both the Girls’ Hostel 
				and Visiting Faculty Hostel. The larger tender amount would have 
				attracted large companies to participate. The Dean &amp; Director 
				wanted to know for which facilities the furniture is yet to be 
				procured. The Director Projects said that the furniture for 
				Admin. Building and the Library at the Main Campus would be 
				arranged by the Registrar. The Director Projects said that for 
				Aman Tower the furniture would be arranged separately. The 
				Registrar said that he was to arrange furniture for classrooms 
				and the seminar rooms only not for the Admin Building and the 
				Library. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director Projects to club 
				the furniture requirements of Admin Building and the Library and 
				handle the procurement. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				1.7 The Committee approved awarding the contract for procurement 
				of furniture for Visiting Faculty Hostel to the lowest bidder, 
				namely, Inspire Interior, at the bid price of Rs.4,149,000/-.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>
				<br>
				1.8 The Director Projects would club the furniture requirements 
				of Admin Building and the Library and handle the procurement.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No. 2 To consider and approve the review of promotion 
				recommendations. </b></u><br>
				<br>

				the promotion rules for non-teaching employees before presenting 
				the Promotion recommendations to the EC. He then informed the 
				members that recommendations for promotion for 21 positions have 
				been received; department-wise break up of which is as under:<br>

				<b>Testing Services:</b><br>
				<br>
				2.2 Dr. Nasir Touheed recommended that the current position of 
				Executive (Testing Services) be up-graded as Sr. Executive 
				(Testing Services) because after the departure of Assistant 
				Testing Coordinator, the present incumbent took over the charge 
				and is performing responsibilities which are higher than his 
				original work assignment. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.3 The Committee accepted the justification for the 
				recommendation presented by Dr. Nasir Touheed. <br>
				<br>
				<b>EMBA Program:</b><br>
				<br>
				2.4 There were recommendations for two different positions at 
				EMBA Program. The first was for up-gradation of the position 
				from Senior Executive (EMBA Program) BPS-16 or equivalent grade 
				to Assistant Manager BPS-17 or equivalent. Before presenting the 
				justifications, Mr. M. Saleem Umer described in detail the 
				various activities the EMBA Program office perform. <br>
				<br>
				2.5 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to what are the 
				differences between the functions of EMBA program as enumerated 
				by Mr. M. Saleem Umer and those of other programs. Mr. Mobin 
				Khalili said that more or less the functions of various program 
				offices are the same except that EMBA program works on Saturdays 
				and Sundays. So the EMBA program receives questions papers too. 
				The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know if result default rate is 
				less in Mr. Saleem Umer’s Program, Mr. Mobin Khalili replied in 
				the negative. <br>
				<br>
				2.6 Mr. Saleem Umer stated that with the increase in number of 
				students, the day to day operational activities of EMBA have 
				increased and due to the flat structure minor operational 
				matters are referred to the Program Director. He said that this 
				up-gradation will address the urgent need of a focal person in 
				the program office who will handle day to day operation and take 
				instant decisions. <br>
				<br>
				2.7 The Dean &amp; Director said that Program Office is the front 
				office where there is no hierarchy; anybody available in the 
				office should handle the inquiries. In front office it is a team 
				work and there should be a team leader. He advised to empower 
				the front line persons. <br>
				<br>
				2.8 Dr. Nasir Afghan suggested that Program Manager’s position 
				should replace Senior Executive position. The Director H.R. said 
				that in transition we can appoint an Assistant Manager.<br>
				<br>
				2.9 The Dean &amp; Director said that the basic difference between 
				the EMBA program and other programs is that for EMBA there is a 
				full time Program Director which is not the case in other 
				programs. He said that ultimately the plan is that we will not 
				have full time program director; we will have faculty members 
				who will be part-time program directors. He said that at this 
				stage we do not fill in the position of Manager EMBA Program but 
				when we make the change from full time to part time program 
				director then we will take a decision about the Program Manager. 
				Mr. Saleem Umer reported that he has taken a course this 
				semester so the part time element will kick in and at an 
				appropriate time he would exit as a full time Program Director. 
				He said that they have to groom someone as the future Program 
				Manager.<br>
				<br>
				2.10 For the second recommendation; Executive (EMBA Program) of 
				BPS-14 or equivalent to Sr. Executive (EMBA Program) of BPS-15 
				or equivalent, Mr. Adnan Hameed said that BPS employees have to 
				serve for a certain period before moving to the next grade, the 
				incumbent was appointed in BPS grades w.e.f. April 1, 2012. As 
				per rules, next grade will be due in five years time.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.11 In light of the discussions noted in 2.9 above, the 
				Committee decided to up-grade the position of Senior Executive 
				to Program Manager of BPS-17 or equivalent and the up-gradation 
				of the position of Executive to Senior Executive. In lieu of the 
				up-gradation of the position of Senior Executive to Program 
				Manager, one position of Executive will be surrendered. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Graduate Program Office:</b><br>
				<br>
				2.12 Dr. Nasir Afghan presented recommendations for up-gradation 
				of three different positions in the MBA Program. The first one 
				was to up-grade the Executive (MBA &amp; Case Unit) to Senior 
				Executive (MBA &amp; Case Unit). Dr. Nasir Afghan said that the job 
				responsibilities are being expanded. The comments from H.R. were 
				that the incumbent moved to Program Office after the resignation 
				of Ms. Romana Shafiq in November 2012. Her full time involvement 
				in MBA Program Office activities has therefore been for last 3 
				to 4 months only. The rules require the recommended position to 
				have worked with additional responsibilities for at least one 
				year. After the remarks by the H.R., this case was withdrawn.<br>
				<br>
				2.13 Dr. Nasir Afghan said that the UDC (Evening MBA Program), 
				City Campus, and the Senior Assistant (Evening MBA Program), 
				Main Campus have equal grades i.e. BPS-10 which should be 
				up-graded to Office Assistant’s position of BPS-14. Mr. Adnan 
				Hameed said that there are approximately 500 students in the 
				Evening at City Campus. He said that recently a position of an 
				Assistant has been approved to support the incumbent at City 
				Campus and the incumbent has already been given senior grade in 
				2011. About the incumbent at Main Campus, Mr. Adnan said that 
				there are approximately 50 students and seniority based grade 
				was also given to the incumbent in 2011. <br>
				<br>
				2.14 The Dean &amp; Director advised Dr. Nasir Afghan that next year 
				if the strength of students is increased, he may bring his 
				recommendation to the EC again. Mr. Mobin Khalili said that the 
				person deputed at the evening has to do many things. He said 
				that there should be person who can deal with confidence and 
				that person should be of Office Assistant level. The Dean &amp; 
				Director said that at this moment there is no urgency but next 
				year we will consider if needed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION<br>
				</b><br>
				2.15 The Committee decided to upgrade the position at the 
				Graduate Program Office (Evening), City Campus to Executive 
				level. The Committee also decided that next year if the strength 
				of MBA Evening students enrolled at the Main Campus rises, 
				up-gradation of the position may be considered.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Examination Department:</b><br>
				<br>
				2.16 Mr. Mobin Khalili said that the Examination Department is 
				in the transition phase; three senior managers have retired and 
				one will be retiring in the first week of April. He said that he 
				is neither demanding rehiring on the vacant positions nor 
				up-gradation of the existing positions. He said that all his 
				recommendations are for promotions to meet the departmental 
				requirements. <br>
				<br>
				2.17 The Dean &amp; Director asked as to how he can promote those 
				who have been promoted in 2012. Mr. Mobin Khalili said that Mr. 
				Mujeebur Rahman is heading the Main Campus examinations and the 
				person below him is also in BPS-16. He said that last year when 
				Mr. Mujeebur Rahman was promoted, the actual recommendation was 
				for BPS-17 but it was said that they would consider it next 
				year. The Dean &amp; Director asked as to what justification he 
				would give to other staff who would claim the same. He said that 
				if in the minutes there is such an explicit commitment then we 
				can consider this case. He said that in the organogram of 
				Examination Department there is a position of BPS-18 for which 
				Mr. Khalili can recommend someone. However, he clarified that 
				the position would be advertised and the procedure would be 
				followed. Mr. Mobin Khalili said that he cannot bring anyone in 
				Examination Department by advertising the position. He said that 
				he would not accept anyone from outside keeping in view the 
				sensitivity of work at the Examination Department.<br>
				<br>
				2.18 Mr. Mobin Khalili said that Mr. Naeemullah Khan, Mr. Bazar 
				Khan, and Mr. Muhammad Mushtaq were given BPS-14 while others 
				have been given BPS-15 although they were regularized as Office 
				Assistant in BPS-14. Mr. Adnan Hameed clarified that those who 
				have been regularized, were given the benefit of one grade on 
				completion of every 5 years of service. Mr. Adnan Hameed said 
				that he would show such cases to Mr. Khalili. <br>
				<br>
				2.19 About the proposal to re-designate Mr. Muhammad Haroon, 
				Office Attendant, in BPS-4 as Gestetner Operator in BPS-5, Mr. 
				Khalili Khalili said that Mr. Haroon has been trained under the 
				supervision of Mr. Farooq, Senior Gestetner Operator, and he 
				would replace Mr. Farooq as a full time Gestetner Operator in 
				Examinations Department. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.20 The Committee approved the re-designation of Mr. Muhammad 
				Haroon as Gestetner Operator in BPS-5.<br>
				<br>
				2.21 For other three recommendations for promotion from BPS-14 
				to 16 of the Examination Department, Mr. Adnan Hameed would show 
				to Mr. Khalili the justifications of regularization of Office 
				Assistants in BPS-15 instead of BPS-14 and also up-date the EC.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.22 Mr. Adnan Hameed would also check if there is any 
				decision/commitment in the minutes of the EC of last year when 
				the promotion and up-gradation of Mr. Mujeeb-ur-Rahman and Mr. 
				Khalil-ul-Rahman were discussed that they would be promoted / 
				up-graded in next grade the following year.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Career Development Centre</b>:<br>
				<br>
				2.23 The Director H.R. said that the scope of work of CDC has 
				increased over the last two years and new initiatives including 
				Student Development Program, IRC (Marketing &amp; Recruitment), IRC 
				program, Academic counselling, enhancement of communications 
				(Social media &amp; SMS) for students and corporations have been 
				taken. Therefore, the position of Assistant Manager CDC in Job 
				Band 2 be enhanced to Manager CDC in Job Band 3.<br>
				<br>
				2.24 The Dean &amp; Director said that the means of communications 
				has changed through which life has become easy. He said that the 
				scope of work has not increased; technology has been 
				substituted. He said that the Director HR is responsible for CDC 
				as well. Once the Director H.R position is abolished, we may 
				consider the position of a Manager for CDC. The Director H.R. 
				said that she may leave in October this year so the position 
				needs to be up-graded. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.25 The Committee approved up-gradation of the position of 
				Assistant Manager-CDC in Job Band 2 to Manager CDC in Job Band 
				3.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Projects Department:</b><br>
				<br>
				2.26 The Director Projects said that last year 5 cases were not 
				approved for promotion and those five cases are being 
				resubmitted this year. So in total there are eight 
				recommendations from Projects Department. He further informed 
				that at present there are 12 projects in hand including the Aman 
				Tower. All of the projects have at least three sub 
				projects/contracts which are processed / procured through the 
				existing procurement procedure and managed separately. He 
				further added that the responsibilities of Mr. Hakimuddin and 
				Mr. Naseem Mumtaz were increased to include major activities 
				related to procurement process in the year 2011 but their 
				promotions were not approved in 2012. Now they are working with 
				additional responsibilities for the last two years. Same is the 
				case of other 3 candidates. He informed the Committee that 
				normally salary adjustments are made every three years but in 
				case of Projects Department no adjustments have been done for 
				the last four years. He requested that the cases be considered 
				as all experienced workers need to be retained since all the 
				ongoing projects are in critical stages and there are still two 
				new projects viz STP and Power Centre are being started in March 
				2013 and the cricket stadium is under design stage and is 
				scheduled to start in June 2013. <br>
				<br>
				2.27 The Dean &amp; Director said that except three projects, all 
				the projects have been completed or will be completed by the end 
				of 2013. He said that it would be difficult to justify 
				promotions of Projects staff. Those who have excelled in 
				performance should be rewarded through salary revision or cash 
				awards. The Director Projects said that the external development 
				project is a huge project besides the Admin Block, the Library, 
				and electrical work at the Main Campus. The Dean &amp; Director said 
				that there is no justification for up-grading eight positions 
				for the remaining four or five projects. He said that in 
				replacement of Senior Manager position vacated by Mr. Mahmood 
				Bughio who has left IBA, the person recommended for that 
				position be upgraded and a replacement of Mehmood Bughio would 
				be arranged by the Director Projects in consultation with the 
				Director H.R.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.28 The Committee decided that instead of promotion or 
				up-gradation the seven persons recommended by the Director 
				Projects may be considered for cash reward or salary revision. 
				In place of Mr. Mahmood Bughio a replacement would be arranged 
				by the Director Projects in consultation with the Director H.R.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>
				<br>
				2.29 For all the positions recommended for promotion / 
				up-gradation, H.R. will follow the laid down procedure. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Item No. 3 To Consider and approve the fee of Project Managers, 
				Students Centre for the extended period.<br>
				<br>
				3.1 The Director Projects reported that the Central Purchase 
				Committee as well as the Executive Committee approved the 
				Extension of contractor from February 15, 2013 to April 30, 2013 
				(2.5 months) in their meeting held on February 16, 2013 and 
				February 18, 2013 respectively. He said that as time for 
				completion works extended up till April 30, 2013 for Contractor, 
				therefore the Project Management Services of M/s INTEG also 
				require to be extended along with contractor’s extension and the 
				monthly remuneration will also require to be approved in order 
				to get the continuous services of M/s INTEG. He said that 
				according to the contract per month remuneration of Project 
				Management Firm is Rs.165,887/- Therefore, the total Fee up till 
				Extended Period of 2 ½ months will be (2.5XRs.165,887) = 
				Rs.414,718/- He said that this cost is only for the extended 
				period other terms and conditions of the contract will remain 
				unchanged.<br>
				<br>
				3.2 The Registrar said that his apprehension is that the project 
				may prolong till August 2013 and again they have to bring it for 
				extension. The Director Projects said that kitchen may be 
				delayed and the completion date for that component may have to 
				be extended. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director Projects to 
				get the work done whatever is to be done till April 30, 2013 and 
				then the remaining work, if any, will be done internally. He 
				made it clear that after April 30, 2013, no extension will be 
				granted.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Committee approved the fee of Project Managers for 
				Students Centre for the extended period of 2.5 months @ 
				Rs.165,887/- per month. The Committee decided that no extension 
				would be given after April 30, 2013 and any work left thereafter 
				will be done internally by the Projects Department in 
				coordination with the Registrar.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><b>Item No. 4 To consider and approve extension in the 
				completion time of the New Academic Block, (Abdul Razzak Tabba 
				Building) Main Campus.</b></u><br>
				<br>
				4.1 The Director Projects reported that the construction of New 
				Academic Block (Abdul Razzak Tabba Building) was awarded to M/s 
				AHCL in February 2011 and commencement of work started in March 
				2011. He said that according to the condition of contracts the 
				completion date for the subject project was August 31, 2012. 
				However, for a number of reasons the Executive Committee was 
				requested to extend the project up till December 16, 2012. The 
				Executive Committee in its meeting held on August 27, 2012 
				approved the extension of time for the project up till December 
				16, 2012. He presented the overview of the Project and said that 
				the project could not be completed in accordance with extended 
				time table due to the following reasons:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Overview of the Project:</b><br>
				<br>
				o Total Plot Area (sft) 44,600<br>
				o Total Covered Area (sft) 48,000 (Ground + 2)<br>
				o Contract Awarded Cost Rs.202,385,590/-<br>
				o Value of Variation Order Rs. 10,956,865/-<br>
				o Value of ID Works Rs. 4,679,818/-<br>
				o Value of additional works Rs. 21,907,818/-<br>
				o Value of walk through works Rs. 2,995,531/-<br>
				o Total value of work Rs.220,301,679/- <br>
				(i.e. 8.85 % of Rs.202,385,590)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Reasons for time extension:</b><br>
				<br>
				o Due to design changes, quality improvements and revisions in 
				drawings by Architects and IBA. He said that since the delays in 
				various activities noted in his presentation have been in 
				parallel and overlapping therefore the day time has been taken 
				as 65 days. <br>
				<br>
				o Delays due to Contractor (AHCL) which included Carpet issue, 
				delivery of tiles, delivery of external pavers, delay in 
				submission of rates of walk through items works, delay in 
				delivery of lift, delay in delivery of UPS, completion of major 
				punch list items. Overall accumulated delays = 45 days<br>
				<br>
				o Due to Client (IBA) which included late approval of carpet 
				sheet / tile rate, curtain wall openable window design, approval 
				of sill-batta, Coping cost, design approval of pavers, computer 
				room seating arrangement approval. Overall accumulated delays = 
				20 days<br>
				o Due to unforeseen incidents including political / religious 
				parties strike calls, rainy days, CNG issues, trucks strike due 
				to which material could not be made available. Overall 
				accumulated delays = 53 days. <br>
				<br>
				4.2 The Director Projects requested for an extension of 100 days 
				(March 31, 2013) so that they may also complete the ID works, 
				additional items, and punch list major works. He said that the 
				Central Purchase Committee has approved this case in its meeting 
				held on Saturday, February 23, 2013. <br>
				<br>
				4.3 The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know if there was any penalty 
				clause for the delay on the part of the architect. The Director 
				Projects said that the penalty clause was removed because the 
				Architects did not agree to sign it. He admitted that it was his 
				mistake that this clause was not included in the RFP. However, 
				he said that even if they put this clause in the RFP the 
				Consultants insist up removing this clause. He said that he 
				would recheck the RFPs of the projects to see if this clause of 
				penalty is there or not. <br>
				<br>
				4.4 The Director Projects said that the cost overrun of the 
				project is by Rs.18 million i.e. 8.85% of the project. The Dean 
				&amp; Director said that he would request Tabba for additional Rs.18 
				million. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				4.5 The Committee approved the extension of 100 days (March 31, 
				2013) in the completion of the project (Abdul Razzak Tabba 
				Building) so that they may also complete the ID works, 
				additional items, and punch list major works.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ACTION</b><br>
				<br>
				4.6 The Director Projects would recheck the RFPs of the projects 
				to see if the penalty clause is included there or not.<br>
				<br>
				4.7 The Dean &amp; Director would request Tabba Foundation for 
				additional Rs.70 million as the final cost of completion is 
				Rs.220 million. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Item No. 5 To consider and approve the Project Management fee of 
				Construction of new Academic Block (Abdul Razzak Tabba Building) 
				to M/s. AAA Partnership for the extended period of 100 days.<br>
				<br>
				5.1 The Director Projects said that the Executive Committee 
				approved the Extension of contractor from August 30, 2012 to 
				December 16, 2012 in its meeting held on August 27, 2012. He 
				said that the total time extended for Contractor is Seven months 
				therefore the Project Management Services will also be required 
				up till the completion date. The Project Management Services of 
				M/s AAA were also extended along with contractors but for their 
				payment the Finance Department wanted to obtain the approval of 
				EC to pay to Project Management fee for the extended period.<br>
				<br>
				5.2 The Director Projects said that according to the contract 
				monthly remuneration of Project Management Firm is Rs.247,578/- 
				Therefore the total fee up till Extended Period claimed comes to 
				= (7 months X Rs.247,578) = Rs.1,733,046/- However, he said that 
				he reduced their fee for next extension because IBA will not pay 
				the salary of Director level person of Project management firm. 
				He proposed a fee of Rs.150,000/- per month for next three 
				months. Hence the total recommended fee now payable for extended 
				period will be as under:<br>
				<br>
				1st Extension<br>
				August 31,2012 to December,2012 (4X247,578) = Rs. 990,312/-<br>
				<br>
				2nd Extension<br>
				January 01, 2013 to March 31,2013 (3X 150,000) = Rs. 450,000/-<br>
				<br>
				The Recommended fee for the total Extended Period is = 
				Rs.1,440,312/-<br>
				<br>
				5.3 The Director Projects reported that the Central Purchase 
				Committee has approved this case in its meeting held on 
				Saturday, February 23, 2013. He requested the Executive 
				Committee to approve the Project Management Fee of 
				Rs.1,440,312/- up till March 31, 2013. He clarified that this 
				cost is only for the extended period other terms and conditions 
				of the contract will remain unchanged.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				5.4 The Committee approved the recommended fee of Rs.1,440,312/- 
				for the Project Management for seven months i.e. till March 31, 
				2013.<br>

				student of EMBA who had requested for a make-up examination due 
				to her hospitalization and her case was discussed in the 233rd 
				EC meeting held on January 14, 2013 where it was decided that 
				Dr. Mohamad Nishat would look into the case. He reported that he 
				discussed this case with Dr. Mohammad Nishat and Mr. Mobin 
				Khalili and they agreed that she should not be given make-up 
				instead of that she be given ‘I’. <br>

				and for almost every examination she requests for a make-up. In 
				this particular case she applied for make-up after a month of 
				the exam. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DECISION</b><br>
				<br>
				6.3 The Committee noted and approved the proposal that Ms. 
				Haniya Channa be given ‘I’ in the courses she missed. The 
				Committee also requested the Associate Dean to talk to the 
				student and let her know that make up exams cannot be allowed on 
				regular basis. <br>

				<br>
				b) Request from a student for make-up examination.<br>
				<br>
				6.5 The Registrar said that he had received a request for 
				make-up examination from a student for the reason that he could 
				not appear in the final exam because his family had to go to 
				Hyderabad to see a family member who was seriously ill and his 
				parents could not leave him alone in Karachi due to security 
				problem. The Registrar said that he did not recommend his case. 
				Mr. Mobin Khalili said that the student did not qualify for 
				make-up examination. <br>
