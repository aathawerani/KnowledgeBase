				<span lang="EN-GB">Mr. M. Sohail Khan, Manager Purchase &amp; 
				Stores, Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed, Manager Operations &amp; Maintenance, 
				Mr. Mahmood Ali, Senior Manager Projects, and Mr. Khalid Rishi, 
				Manager Security attended the meeting on special invitation. <br>
				<br>
				The following items were discussed: <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.1 <u>Recommendation for amendment in Item No.1 of the 
				284th meeting of EC held on February 17, 2014.</u></b> <br>
				<br>
				<b>1.1</b> Mr. M. Sohail Khan, Manager Purchase &amp; Stores 
				referred to item # 1: ‘To Consider &amp; Approve the Standardization 
				of Electrical Items for Maintenance Department’ discussed in 
				284th meeting of Executive Committee wherein it was decided vide 
				Point # 1.8 to prequalify the four cable manufacturer i.e., 
				Pakistan Cables, Newage, Pioneer Cables &amp; Universal and issue 
				tender. He submitted that they have to adopt prequalification 
				process as per SPPRA if they consider the decision. Hence not 
				only the identified four manufacturers, other manufacturers 
				i.e., Million Cables, HM Cables etc would also apply and they 
				would be compelled to prequalify them. While Manager Operations 
				&amp; Maintenance intends to select only Pakistan Cable as standard 
				for IBA use due to quality and standardization reason. Mr. 
				Sohail Khan suggested to amend the decision of 284th meeting of 
				EXCO vide Point #1.8 and instead of using the words of 
				“prequalify &amp; tender” just use the text of Point # 1.7 i.e. “The 
				Committee approved the proposal of Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed for brand 
				names of .......”.<br>
				<br>
				<b>1.2</b> Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed said that the EC has recommended 
				to prequalify Pakistan Cables, Newage, Pioneer Cables, and 
				Universal but the Purchase Department has difficulty because 
				there is a complete process of prequalification which they have 
				to follow. The Director Projects said that the cables that have 
				been used in IBA projects are mostly from the above mentioned 
				four manufacturers. The Dean &amp; Director said that for repair and 
				maintenance we will use the same cable which has been installed 
				in our premises and therefore it is logical to prequalify only 
				the above four companies. The maintenance staff have the 
				responsibility to follow the same pattern. If the cable of 
				Pakistan Cables is to be replaced it is to be replaced with 
				Pakistan Cable. The Director Projects clarified that the four 
				cable manufacturers have been pre-qualified and selected through 
				the Consultants on product merit. <br>
				<br>
				<b>1.3</b> The Dean &amp; Director said that as long as those 
				companies which have been screened by experts / consultants are 
				pre-qualified through an open, competitive process there should 
				not be any problem. The Director Projects said that he can give 
				in writing that the cables used in IBA Projects including 
				External Development were based on Consultants specifications. 
				The Consultants had prequalified the four and the existing 
				network of cables depends on these four companies and their 
				replacement should be from them not from others. <br>
				<br>
				<b>1.4</b> Mr. M. Sohail Khan requested that similar 
				specifications / identification of manufacturers should be made 
				for paints. The Dean &amp; Director asked the Director Projects to 
				provide the same.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				<b>1.5</b> It was decided that the Director Projects would send 
				a note to the Manager Purchase stating that the cables used in 
				IBA Projects including External Development project were 
				purchased from Pakistan Cables, Newage, Pioneer Cables &amp; 
				Universal. These four companies (Pakistan Cables, Newage, 
				Pioneer Cables &amp; Universal) were pre-qualified and selected by 
				the Consultants. For repair and maintenance, cables from the 
				same companies should be used. Similarly the Director Projects 
				would send the specifications / identification of paint 
				manufacturers given by the Consultants. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No. 2 <u>To consider and approve the provision of wire 
				fencing around bulk water supply and bulk power supply at the 
				IBA. </u></b><br>
				<br>
				<b>2.1</b> The Registrar said that the staff town is spread over 
				14 acres, and it has a perimeter which runs around staff town 
				which is almost 8 KM long. He said that the bulk water supply 
				and bulk power supply are just within the boundary wall of IBA 
				Staff Town. He suggested that in order to provide security, 
				barbed wire be placed around the wall of bulk water supply and 
				bulk power supply. The total length is 550 rft for the bulk 
				water supply and 310 rft for bulk power supply. The Director 
				Projects said that the existing wall does not have foundation. 
				Mr. Mahmood Ali suggested that they have to erect a column in 
				between the wall at certain intervals. Mr. Khalid Rishi said 
				that there would be block masonary so that the wall is raised 
				upto 8 feet and then a 2 feet barbed wire should be placed. The 
				Registrar said that although he has not obtained the estimate, 
				the rough idea is that it would cost around Rs.1 million. <br>
				<br>
				<b>2.2</b> The Dean &amp; Director said that we have to protect the 
				key installations points and for night one dedicated guard 
				should be deputed for bulk power supply and bulk water power 
				installations. He said that we have to protect all the 
				installations. He inquired if City Campus, and Boys Hostel 
				installations are secured. Mr. Khalid Rishi confirmed that they 
				were secure. The Dean &amp; Director advised to make a drill with 
				staff and students for evacuation from the buildings in 
				emergency. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
				<br>
				<b>2.3</b> The Committee approved the proposal of wire fencing 
				around bulk water supply and bulk power supply. The Registrar 
				would obtain estimate for the proposed wire fencing and get it 
				approved by the Dean &amp; Director.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.3 <u>Up-date on the submission of final 
				Implementation Report.</u></b><br>
				<br>
				<b>3.1</b> Mr. Adnan Hameed reported that the Implementation 
				Report from CED, CBER, LMS, Resource Mobilization and Library 
				have not been received.<br>
				<br>
				<b>3.2</b> The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Moeid Sultan to give a 
				note on the facilities provided to the staff i.e. regularization 
				to BPS, introduction of provident fund and gratuity schemes, 
				health insurance, and other welfare schemes introduced from 2008 
				todate. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				3.3 The Committee noted the up-date on the submission of final 
				Implementation Report. <br>
				<br>
				ACTION<br>
				<br>
				3.4 Mr. Moeid Sultan would provide account of staff welfare 
				measures taken from 2008 to-date to Mr. Adnan Hameed for 
				inclusion in the final Implementation Report.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.4 <u>To consider and approve the advance payment to 
				M/s. Sheetal for material purchase and extension of time. </u>
				</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>4.1</b> The Director Projects reported that the supply and 
				fixing of furniture work was awarded to M/s Sheetal on November 
				13, 2013 at a cost of Rs.21,201,352. The total time duration for 
				the subject work was 03 months as per the schedule of the 
				completion of building works. Unfortunately, the building works 
				could not be completed as per schedule, however the furniture 
				vendor completed the 35% manufacturing since eight months ago 
				and due to space limitation could not deliver the manufactured 
				furniture in IBA premises. The Inspection of completed furniture 
				was done jointly by IBA engineer and Architect at their 
				workshop. He reported that the furniture vendor completed the 
				work as per their time schedule except 400 chairs among which 
				200 were not finalized. The approval of reading chair was given 
				by the head librarian on June 20, 2014.<br>
				<br>
				<b>4.2 </b>The Director Projects informed the Committee that M/s 
				Sheetal vide their letter claimed the overhead and profit of 
				about Rs.4.5 million due to delay in receiving the completed 
				furniture and delay in approval. They also requested to release 
				an amount of Rs.4 million in order to further purchase of 
				material. IBA Projects Department negotiated with the contractor 
				in order to withdraw their claim against the release of an 
				amount of Rs.4 million after submission of Insurance guarantee 
				of an equal amount from their project cost.<br>
				<br>
				<b>4.3</b> The Procurement Committee in its meeting held on 28th 
				June 2014 considered and approved the extension in time up till 
				September 30, 2014 (7.5 Months) based on the merit of the case. 
				The Committee also recommended the special advance to be paid 
				subject to the amount to be decided by the Executive Committee 
				against insurance guarantee. <br>
				<br>
				<b>4.4</b> The Director Projects presented the following 
				summarized reasons for delay:</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB"><b>4.5</b> The Dean &amp; Director said that our 
				objective is to get the work done and get the library ready in 
				all respect. He said that we cannot penalize other 
				sub-contractors because of the negligence and non-payment by the 
				main contractor. <br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				<b>4.6</b> The Committee approved Rs.4 million as advance 
				payment to M/s. Sheetal for material purchase against insurance 
				guarantee and allowed extension of time up till September 30, 
				2014 (7.5 Months).<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.5 <u>To consider cancellation of bids for 
				construction of clinic building. </u></b><br>
				<br>
				<b>5.1</b> The Director Projects reported that an advertisement 
				for the pre-qualification of contractors for above subject works 
				was published in daily newspapers on November 05, 2013. In 
				response to the advertisement 20 contractors submitted their 
				document and only 11 contractors met the evaluation criteria and 
				stood qualified. Bid Invitation letters were sent to all 
				qualified contractors.<br>
				<br>
				<b>5.2</b> The Bids were opened in front of all contractor 
				representative and IBA officials. The amount of lowest Bidder 
				was Rs.24,413,027/- which was higher than the budgeted amount. 
				In order to reduce the project cost, Architect was advised to do 
				value engineering to meet the budgeted cost. After value 
				engineering Architect prepared revised BOQ with the engineering 
				estimates of Rs.18.27 million.<br>
				<br>
				<b>5.3</b> Revised Bid Invitation letters were sent to those 
				bidders who have participated in first bidding. M/s. Banu 
				Mukhtar Contracting regretted to participate. The revised Bids 
				were opened in front of all bidders representative and IBA 
				officials. After detailed scrutiny it was found that 1st lowest 
				M/s Hasscon is 11% lower than Engineering Estimate 
				(Rs.18,272,101)<br>
				<br>
				<b>5.4</b> The Director Projects stated that the request for 
				approval of award of work was submitted to all IBA Committees 
				i.e PC, EC and A&amp;FC. Two committees (PC and EC) approved the 
				award of work to the lowest bidder. However the Audit and 
				Finance Committee rejected the bids advising that the cost of 
				construction was too high and that the clinic should not be that 
				large. They further advised that the clinic be re-designed as a 
				simple building with simple fittings and fixtures to bring down 
				the cost. The Director Projects said that under this advice they 
				need to go for re-designing of the building and will have to go 
				for fresh tendering as it is not possible to make amendments in 
				the existing plan. He reported that the Procurement Committee in 
				its meeting held on 28th June 2014 approved the cancellation of 
				the bids based on above reasons. He requested the Executive 
				Committee to approve the cancellation of the bids of the Clinic.<br>
				<br>
				<b>5.5</b> The Director Projects said that the tender and 
				redesigning will take time and it would not be completed by 
				December 2014. The Dean &amp; Director suggested to start the 
				process of redesigning and tendering but the construction of 
				clinic should start after Convocation as he did not want any 
				site showing an incomplete structure.<br>
				<br>
				DECISION<br>
				<br>
				<b>5.6</b> The Committee approved the cancellation of bids for 
				construction of clinic building. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Item No.6 <u>Any other item with the permission of the Chair.
				</u></b><br>
				<br>
				<b>a) Issues in Maintenance Contract.</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>6.1</b> Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed reported that they have a Service 
				and Maintenance Contract with M/s Ezzi Engineering for Fire 
				Alarm System. He said that a defected part has been replaced but 
				the Finance Department says that there is no mention in the 
				service contract regarding replacement of parts; it includes 
				only service charges. <br>
				<br>
				<b>6.2</b> The Dean &amp; Director said that in all maintenance 
				contract there are two components; service, and replacement of 
				equipment and parts at the prevailing rates. All service 
				contract already included services as well as replacement of 
				parts.<br>
