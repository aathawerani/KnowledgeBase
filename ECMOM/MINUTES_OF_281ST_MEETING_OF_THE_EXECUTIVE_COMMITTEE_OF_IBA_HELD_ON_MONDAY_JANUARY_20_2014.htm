		<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="en-gb">Mr. Khalid Pervez of KP 
		Associates, Syed Fahim Uddin, Manager (General Maintenance &amp; Security), 
		Mr. Khalid Javed Rishi, Manager Security, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed, Manager 
		Operations &amp; Maintenance, and Mr. Muhammad Asif Jaffer, Assistant 
		Professor &amp; Patron, IQRA Society of IBA attended the meeting on special 
		invitation. <br>
		<br>
		The following items were discussed: <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 1 Presentation on “IBA Fire Alarm System”.</b><br>
		<br>
		1.1 The Director Projects said that individual buildings do not have 
		integrated fire alarm system therefore, he has requested Mr. Khalid 
		Pervez of KP Associates to give a presentation on Integrated Campus Fire 
		Alarm System. The Dean &amp; Director wanted to know as to what is the 
		response time if there is any detection of fire and what are the 
		procedures to mobilize fire fighting manpower if there is any fire 
		incident. Mr. Mushtaq said that presently they do not have any automatic 
		suppression system. It is through manual hoses that fire is suppressed. 
		Mr. Khalid Pervez said that different buildings are isolated from each 
		other and there is no connection among these buildings. He said that he 
		has proposed to integrate these buildings with a Central Command Station 
		so that if there is a fire, the information should reach the Central 
		Command Station and fire fighting measures may be initiated. The Dean &amp; 
		Director said that it is the first step; detection is only one part of 
		the system, the second is timely response and suppression and the third 
		is the rescue and evacuation. The whole system should be interlinked. 
		Mr. Khalid Rishi said that he has prepared SOP for that and said that it 
		is a joint work as far as responsibility is concerned. He said that he 
		has the approval of a Fire fighting officer and his assistant and has 
		requested Mr. Adnan Hameed to arrange their hiring. The Dean &amp; Director 
		said that it is not a full time job; the fire fighting officer can be 
		assigned other duties too. The Registrar said that the fire fighting 
		equipment has not yet been tested. As far as fire fighting equipment is 
		concerned, we have not drilled it. Syed Fahim Uddin said that at Aman 
		CED Building they have done it. <br>
		<br>
		1.2 Mr. Khalid Pervez made a presentation on Integrated Campus Fire 
		Alarm System. He presented an overview of 11 buildings/facilities at the 
		Main Campus. Emphasising on the need for Integrated Fire Alarm System he 
		said that integrating the system and connecting it to a Central Fire 
		Alarm Control Panel (FACP) will enable monitoring the entire campus from 
		one location. He said that the proposed scope of work is:<br>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Combined Monitoring at two places</li>
		<li>Developing Campus Wide Network</li>
		<li>Hooking up the following:</li>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Multi-purpose</li>
		<li>ACED</li>
		<li>New Academic Block</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		<p align="justify">
		<br>
		1.3 Mr. Khalid Pervez said that to develop a network the FACPs must be 
		of Addressable type and have networking capability. He clarified that 
		the difference between addressable system and conventional system is 
		that the addressable system pin points single device and identifies 
		which one has problem whereas the conventional one identifies at a 
		larger level. He said that the following buildings have conventional 
		type of FACPs:<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Admin Block</li>
		<li>Library</li>
		<li>Auditorium</li>
		<li>Old Academic Block</li>
		<li>Students Centre</li>
		</ul>
		<p align="justify">
		<br>
		1.4 Mr. Khalid Pervez suggested that the existing FACPs be replaced with 
		those of Addressable type along with other interface cards. He presented 
		the following cost estimates:<br>
		<br>
		Cost of System as per BoQ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rs.2.45 million<br>
		Cost to integrate all buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rs.4.71 million<br>
		Additional Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rs.2.26 million<br>
		<br>
		1.5 Mr. Khalid Pervez said that there two options: (a) Follow the 
		original scope and build campus wide network, hooking up three 
		buildings, or (b) Build a full fledge network with additional cost of 
		Rs.2.26 million.<br>
		<br>
		1.6 The Dean &amp; Director asked as to what is the main component of this 
		additional cost. Mr. Khalid Pervez said that the fire alarm control 
		panel which is to be replaced in the above mentioned five buildings. The 
		Dean &amp; Director further asked as to what are the draw backs of 
		conventional system. Mr. Khalid Pervez clarified that conventional 
		systems are non-networkable. The Registrar said that all sensors are 
		connected to one panel and if any sensor is activated the light will be 
		on. He wanted to know if there is any simple and cost effective 
		solution. He said that a security guard will also be available in the 
		building whose duty it will be to communicate to the Control Room if 
		there is any fire incident. Mr. Khalid Pervez said that there are human 
		aspects; maybe the guard is not available at that time. The Director 
		Projects said that we have invested billions of rupees on our buildings. 
		He said that spending Rs.2.26 million additional to save our property is 
		not too much amount. The Dean &amp; Director said that we should take 
		preventive measures so that the probability of occurrence of any fire 
		incident becomes very low. He said that spending additional Rs.2.26 
		million for fine tuning the detection system is not justifiable if other 
		alternative means are available and are equally effective. He said that 
		the risk of human error is halved because six of the buildings are 
		already connected to the control panel through addressable devices. Mr. 
		Khalid Rishi suggested that one or two mega pixel cameras with audio in 
		front of the panel can be placed and it will be connected to the control 
		panel. The Dean &amp; Director asked Mr. Khalid Pervez if the existing IP 
		cameras can be integrated to the system. Mr. Khalid Pervez said that the 
		US Fire Alarm Code requires an independent fire network, it cannot be 
		mixed up. The Dean &amp; Director requested Mr. Khalid Pervez and Mr. Khalid 
		Rishi to jointly find an alternate solution which meets our requirements 
		which is cost effective and suggest to the EC for approval after review 
		by the Director Projects and Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed and their 
		recommendations.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		1.7 Mr. Khalid Pervez and Mr. Khalid Rishi in light of the above 
		suggestions would jointly find an alternative cost effective solution 
		and present it to the EC for approval after review by the Director 
		Projects and Mr. Mushtaque Ahmed and their recommendations.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.2 Status Reports from Associate Deans. </b> <br>
		<br>
		<b>2.1 Associate Deans to come up with a proposal to ensure on campus 
		availability of faculty at least for 30 to 40 hours:</b> Dr. Sayeed Ghani 
		reported that as per discussion during Spring 2014 presence of faculty 
		members at City Campus will be frequently monitored by him and at the 
		Main Campus by Dr. Muhammad Nishat. Subsequent to this appropriate 
		recommendations will be made. <br>
		<br>
		The Dean &amp; Director asked the Associate Deans to instruct faculty 
		members to post their counselling hours on the door of their respective 
		offices and also strictly follow it. <br>
		<br>
		<b>2.2 Imposition of fine on late submission of results:</b> Dr. Nishat and Dr. 
		Sayeed Ghani reported that a notice to this effect is being circulated 
		to all faculty members effective immediately.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION &amp; ACTION<br>
		<br>
		2.3 The up-dates given above were noted and approved.<br>
		<br>
		2.4 The Associate Deans would instruct their respective faculty to post 
		their counselling hours on the door of their offices and strictly follow 
		it.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No.3 Donation of Solar PV System for Prayer Hall at Main Campus.
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		2.5 The Director Projects reported that a company namely ‘Adaptive 
		Technologies (Pvt) Limited’ has offered to supply and install ‘Solar PV 
		System’ based on solar energy, producing 750 watts of electricity to 
		‘Pervez Abbasi Prayer Hall’ at Main Campus. He said that the system has 
		been checked by Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed, Maintenance Manager, and according to 
		him the system is viable with some amendments. He requested the 
		Executive Committee to consider and approve this offer from a commercial 
		organization for IBA. To a query the Director Projects replied that the 
		system is being provided free of cost by the company. <br>
		<br>
		2.6 The Dean &amp; Director appreciated the offer of Solar PV System for 
		Prayer Hall at Main Campus free of cost by M/s. Adaptive Technologies (Pvt.) 
		Ltd. He suggested that for all our geysers installed at boys’ and girls’ 
		hostel, and visiting faculty hostel solar heating system should be used. 
		He asked the Director Projects to take advice from Adaptive Technologies 
		for using solar heated geysers. He asked Mr. Mushtaq to see what would 
		be its per watt cost and if it is cheaper then we may switch to solar 
		system.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		2.7 The Committee appreciated and accepted the offer of Solar PV System 
		for Prayer Hall at Main Campus free of cost by M/s. Adaptive 
		Technologies (Pvt.) Ltd. <br>
		<br>
		ACTION<br>
		<br>
		2.8 The Director Projects would seek advice from Adaptive Technologies 
		for using solar heated geysers. <br>
		<br>
		2.9 Mr. Mushtaq to see as to what would be the per watt cost of the 
		Solar PV System for Prayer Hall and advise the EC accordingly.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Item No. 4 Suggestions on Design Aspects of Prayer Hall. </b> <br>
		<br>
		4.1 Mr. M Asif Jaffer, Assistant Professor and Patron IQRA Society IBA, 
		stated that as agreed earlier by IBA management, the existing design of 
		the Prayer Hall needs to be customized in accordance with our needs. He 
		proposed the following suggestions for consideration by management. He 
		informed that for a month or so he was in the process of consolidating 
		feedback from IBA community on this who were showing their concern and 
		suggesting on some of the design aspects:<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">There are almost 40% girl students, even in IQRA Society there are more 
		girls than boys. Overall number of students is also increasing but the 
		new girls’ prayer area is smaller than the older one. It is even 
		difficult to accommodate praying girls there, let alone having any 
		lectures or sessions. Thus there is immediate need to provide more space 
		for female namazis. It was proposed that the front part of the old 
		mosque be retained in its existing form for girls. The open lawn area 
		can be demolished. A number of problems can be solved without 
		compromising the overall campus planned architecture, without any need 
		to customize the new prayer place and even avoiding the need to convert 
		the large break out rooms in the Tabba South Wing, which the Registrar 
		mentioned he would reserve for girls’ prayers and IQRA sessions once the 
		library shifts out.</li><br>
		<br>
		<li>The present girls’ area in the new prayer hall then can be used for IQRA 
		sessions / Quran reading room for boys, thereby having least disturbance 
		to those offering prayer.</li><br>
		<br>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">There is a need to cover the inner walls of prayer area with glass wall 
		around to protect it from noise (disturbing), dust (right now when one 
		offers prayer there, dust sticks on clothes) and cold. The plan has 
		already been discussed with in-house experts and an aluminium frame and 
		dark glasses with windows in between, fixed from top and bottom, would 
		be ideal. This way we shall keep advantage of day light and probably 
		shall not require air conditioning system in summers as fans and windows 
		will suffice.</li></ul>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<br>
		4.2 Mr. Asif Jaffer said that mosques, in earlier Muslim history, were 
		not only the places of prayers but also a center for many positive 
		community and social activities. He said that his assumption is that the 
		Dean &amp; Director Dr. Ishrat Husain had also proposed this when in the 
		inauguration ceremony he referred and talked to some of IQRA members 
		that we should have IQRA sessions there as well. <br>
		<br>
		4.3 The Dean &amp; Director said that according to External Development Plan 
		the old mosque was to be demolished. He wanted to know as to what would 
		be the impact if it is retained. The Director Projects said that he had 
		discussed this with Mr. Shabih and reported that they would retain the 
		mosque and at the same time have pathways by cutting and re-fixing some 
		portion. He said that the veranda of the mosque would be removed and the 
		partition between boys and girls would also be removed as it would be 
		for the females only. He said that he would ask the architect to develop 
		some landscaping in front of the old mosque and also beautify the 
		mosque. He further said that the ablution area at boys’ side would be 
		removed and the existing ablution arrangement at girls side would be 
		expanded to make arrangement for four from existing two.<br>
		<br>
		4.4 About covering the inner walls of prayer area of the Prayer Hall, 
		the Registrar said that it involves an estimated expenditure of Rs.1 
		million. However, he said that the first work of wind-wall would be

		<b>Item No. 5 Any other item with the permission of the Chair.</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>a) Handheld Explosive Detector.</b> <br>
		<br>
		5.1 Mr. Khalid Rishi said that the EC had earlier given approval for 
		Sniffex Handheld Explosive Detector which costs around Rs.100,000/- 
		However, he reported that he has got the same kind of detector which is 
		being supplied to Army but at a very cheaper cost. He said that one 
		Major (Retd.) Tanveer is supplying the detector to Army at Rs.500/- 
		each. For civilians he charges Rs.50,000/- but to IBA he has agreed to 
		provide at Rs.10,000/- each.<br>
		<br>
		DECISION<br>
		<br>
		5.2 The Dean &amp; Director appreciated the efforts of Mr. Khalid Rishi and 
		advised him to try to convince Major (Retd.) Tanveer to provide the 
		Detector to IBA at the same rate i.e. Rs.500/- or the maximum of 
		Rs.1000/- each. <br>
		<br>
		There being no other issue, the meeting was concluded with a vote of 
		thanks to the Chair.<br>
